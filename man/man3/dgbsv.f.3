\fB DGBSV computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for GB matrices\fP (simple driver)  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 DGBSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
 A * X = B, where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals
 and KU superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 The LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row interchanges is
 used to factor A as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation
 and unit lower triangular matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is
 upper triangular with KL+KU superdiagonals.  The factored form of A
 is then used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.

          AB is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAB,N)
          On entry, the matrix A in band storage, in rows KL+1 to
          2*KL+KU+1; rows 1 to KL of the array need not be set.
          The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
          array AB as follows:
          AB(KL+KU+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KU)<=i<=min(N,j+KL)
          On exit, details of the factorization: U is stored as an
          upper triangular band matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in
          rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and the multipliers used during the
          factorization are stored in rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.

  The band storage scheme is illustrated by the following example, when
  M = N = 6, KL = 2, KU = 1:

  On entry:                       On exit:

      *    *    *    +    +    +       *    *    *   u14  u25  u36
      *    *    +    +    +    +       *    *   u13  u24  u35  u46
      *   a12  a23  a34  a45  a56      *   u12  u23  u34  u45  u56
     a11  a22  a33  a44  a55  a66     u11  u22  u33  u44  u55  u66
     a21  a32  a43  a54  a65   *      m21  m32  m43  m54  m65   *
     a31  a42  a53  a64   *    *      m31  m42  m53  m64   *    *

  Array elements marked * are not used by the routine; elements marked
  + need not be set on entry, but are required by the routine to store
  elements of U because of fill-in resulting from the row interchanges.
