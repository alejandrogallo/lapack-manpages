.nf
 ZLATRZ factors the M-by-(M+L) complex upper trapezoidal matrix
 [ A1 A2 ] = [ A(1:M,1:M) A(1:M,N-L+1:N) ] as ( R  0 ) * Z by means
 of unitary transformations, where  Z is an (M+L)-by-(M+L) unitary
 matrix and, R and A1 are M-by-M upper triangular matrices.

.nf
  The factorization is obtained by Householder's method.  The kth
  transformation matrix, Z( k ), which is used to introduce zeros into
  the ( m - k + 1 )th row of A, is given in the form

     Z( k ) = ( I     0   ),
              ( 0  T( k ) )

  where

     T( k ) = I - tau*u( k )*u( k )**H,   u( k ) = (   1    ),
                                                 (   0    )
                                                 ( z( k ) )

  tau is a scalar and z( k ) is an l element vector. tau and z( k )
  are chosen to annihilate the elements of the kth row of A2.

  The scalar tau is returned in the kth element of TAU and the vector
  u( k ) in the kth row of A2, such that the elements of z( k ) are
  in  a( k, l + 1 ), ..., a( k, n ). The elements of R are returned in
  the upper triangular part of A1.

  Z is given by

     Z =  Z( 1 ) * Z( 2 ) * ... * Z( m ).
