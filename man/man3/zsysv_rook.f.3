.nf
 ZSYSV_ROOK computes the solution to a complex system of linear
 equations
    A * X = B,
 where A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
 matrices.

 The diagonal pivoting method is used to factor A as
    A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
    A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
 where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
 triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

 ZSYTRF_ROOK is called to compute the factorization of a complex
 symmetric matrix A using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman ("rook") diagonal
 pivoting method.

 The factored form of A is then used to solve the system
 of equations A * X = B by calling ZSYTRS_ROOK.

          NRHS is INTEGER

          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading

\fIIPIV\fP

.nf
          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D,
          as determined by ZSYTRF_ROOK.

          If UPLO = 'U':
               If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
               were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

               D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

          If UPLO = 'L':
               If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
               were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

               If IPIV(k) < 0 and IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and

\fIWORK\fP 
.PP
.nf
          WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

\fILWORK\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LWORK is INTEGER
          The length of WORK.  LWORK >= 1, and for best performance
          LWORK >= max(1,N*NB), where NB is the optimal blocksize for
          ZSYTRF_ROOK.

          TRS will be done with Level 2 BLAS

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

\fIINFO\fP

          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0: successful exit
          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0: if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
               has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
               exactly singular, so the solution could not be computed.
