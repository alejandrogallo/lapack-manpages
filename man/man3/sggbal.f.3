\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SGGBAL balances a pair of general real matrices (A,B).  This
 involves, first, permuting A and B by similarity transformations to
 isolate eigenvalues in the first 1 to ILO$-$1 and last IHI+1 to N
 elements on the diagonal; and second, applying a diagonal similarity
 transformation to rows and columns ILO to IHI to make the rows
 and columns as close in norm as possible. Both steps are optional.

 Balancing may reduce the 1-norm of the matrices, and improve the
 accuracy of the computed eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors in the
 generalized eigenvalue problem A*x = lambda*B*x.

.nf
          JOB is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the operations to be performed on A and B:
          = 'N':  none:  simply set ILO = 1, IHI = N, LSCALE(I) = 1.0
                  and RSCALE(I) = 1.0 for i = 1,...,N.
          = 'P':  permute only;
          = 'S':  scale only;
          = 'B':  both permute and scale.

          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.

.nf
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the input matrix A.

          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,N)
          On entry, the input matrix B.

          IHI is INTEGER
          ILO and IHI are set to integers such that on exit

.nf
          LSCALE is REAL array, dimension (N)
          Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied

          row interchanged with row j, and D(j)
          is the scaling factor applied to row j, then
            LSCALE(j) = P(j)    for J = 1,...,ILO-1
