.nf
 SSYCON_3 estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
 1-norm) of a real symmetric matrix A using the factorization
 computed by DSYTRF_RK or DSYTRF_BK:

    A = P*U*D*(U**T)*(P**T) or A = P*L*D*(L**T)*(P**T),

 where U (or L) is unit upper (or lower) triangular matrix,
 U**T (or L**T) is the transpose of U (or L), P is a permutation
 matrix, P**T is the transpose of P, and D is symmetric and block
 diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

 An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
 condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
 This routine uses BLAS3 solver SSYTRS_3.

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are
          stored as an upper or lower triangular matrix:
          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = P*U*D*(U**T)*(P**T);
          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = P*L*D*(L**T)*(P**T).

          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

\fIA\fP

.nf
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
          Diagonal of the block diagonal matrix D and factors U or L

            a) ONLY diagonal elements of the symmetric block diagonal
               matrix D on the diagonal of A, i.e. D(k,k) = A(k,k);
               (superdiagonal (or subdiagonal) elements of D
                should be provided on entry in array E), and
            b) If UPLO = 'U': factor U in the superdiagonal part of A.
