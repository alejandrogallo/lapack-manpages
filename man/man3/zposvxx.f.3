\fB ZPOSVXX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for PO matrices\fP  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
    ZPOSVXX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T
    to compute the solution to a complex*16 system of linear equations
    A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix
    and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

    If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
    are returned. ZPOSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
    guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
    precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
    case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
    calculated and returned.

    ZPOSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
    factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
    Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
    ZPOSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
    errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
    user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
    differ from what ZPOSVXX would itself produce.

\fBDescription: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
    The following steps are performed:

    1. If FACT = 'E', double precision scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:

      diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

    2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
    factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
       A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
    where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
    matrix.

    3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
    then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
    form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
    A (see argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number
    is less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
    for X and compute error bounds as described below.

    4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

    5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
    the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
    error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
    least twice the working precision.

    6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
    equilibration.
.fi
.PP
 
.PP
.nf
     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
     the PARAMS argument.

     diag(S)*A*diag(S).  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N upper

     the strictly upper triangular part of A is not referenced.  A is
     not modified if FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED =

     format as A.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AF is the factored

     returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
     factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the original

\fIS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
     The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
     that may not be reliable.

\fIRCOND\fP

.nf
          RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-

\fIRPVGRW\fP 
.PP
.nf
          RPVGRW is DOUBLE PRECISION
     Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
     pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
     norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
     the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
     This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
     and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
     0<INFO<=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
     for the leading INFO columns of A.

     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about

     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:

            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith

              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
