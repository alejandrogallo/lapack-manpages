\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CGEBD2 reduces a complex general m by n matrix A to upper or lower
 real bidiagonal form B by a unitary transformation: Q**H * A * P = B.

 If m >= n, B is upper bidiagonal; if m < n, B is lower bidiagonal.

  The matrices Q and P are represented as products of elementary
  reflectors:

  If m >= n,

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n)  and  P = G(1) G(2) . . . G(n-1)

  Each H(i) and G(i) has the form:

     H(i) = I - tauq * v * v**H  and G(i) = I - taup * u * u**H

  where tauq and taup are complex scalars, and v and u are complex
  vectors; v(1:i-1) = 0, v(i) = 1, and v(i+1:m) is stored on exit in
  A(i+1:m,i); u(1:i) = 0, u(i+1) = 1, and u(i+2:n) is stored on exit in
  A(i,i+2:n); tauq is stored in TAUQ(i) and taup in TAUP(i).

  If m < n,

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(m-1)  and  P = G(1) G(2) . . . G(m)

  Each H(i) and G(i) has the form:

     H(i) = I - tauq * v * v**H  and G(i) = I - taup * u * u**H

  where tauq and taup are complex scalars, v and u are complex vectors;
  v(1:i) = 0, v(i+1) = 1, and v(i+2:m) is stored on exit in A(i+2:m,i);
  u(1:i-1) = 0, u(i) = 1, and u(i+1:n) is stored on exit in A(i,i+1:n);
  tauq is stored in TAUQ(i) and taup in TAUP(i).

  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples:

  m = 6 and n = 5 (m > n):          m = 5 and n = 6 (m < n):

    (  d   e   u1  u1  u1 )           (  d   u1  u1  u1  u1  u1 )
    (  v1  d   e   u2  u2 )           (  e   d   u2  u2  u2  u2 )
    (  v1  v2  d   e   u3 )           (  v1  e   d   u3  u3  u3 )
    (  v1  v2  v3  d   e  )           (  v1  v2  e   d   u4  u4 )
    (  v1  v2  v3  v4  d  )           (  v1  v2  v3  e   d   u5 )
    (  v1  v2  v3  v4  v5 )

  where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of B, vi
  denotes an element of the vector defining H(i), and ui an element of
  the vector defining G(i).
