.PP
.nf
 CHECON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a complex
 Hermitian matrix A using the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
 A = L*D*L**H computed by CHETRF.

 An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
 condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**H;
          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**H.
