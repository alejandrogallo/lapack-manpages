\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SSYGVD computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
 of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
 A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.  Here A and
 B are assumed to be symmetric and B is also positive definite.
 If eigenvectors are desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.

 The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
 floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
 digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
 digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
 Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
 without guard digits, but we know of none.

          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.

\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA, N)
          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
          leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
          upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
          the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
          the lower triangular part of the matrix A.

          On exit, if JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, A contains the
          matrix Z of eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors are normalized
          as follows:
          if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**T*B*Z = I;
          if ITYPE = 3, Z**T*inv(B)*Z = I.
          If JOBZ = 'N', then on exit the upper triangle (if UPLO='U')
          or the lower triangle (if UPLO='L') of A, including the
          diagonal, is destroyed.

.nf
          B is REAL array, dimension (LDB, N)
          On entry, the symmetric matrix B.  If UPLO = 'U', the

          the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of B contains
          the lower triangular part of the matrix B.

          On exit, if INFO <= N, the part of B containing the matrix is
          overwritten by the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
          factorization B = U**T*U or B = L*L**T.

          LWORK is INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK.

          If JOBZ = 'V' and N > 1, LWORK >= 1 + 6*N + 2*N**2.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK and IWORK
          arrays, returns these values as the first entries of the WORK
          and IWORK arrays, and no error message related to LWORK or
          LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.

          If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK and
          IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
          the WORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message related to

                    minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
                    The factorization of B could not be completed and
                    no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.

  Modified so that no backsubstitution is performed if SSYEVD fails to
  converge (NEIG in old code could be greater than N causing out of
  bounds reference to A - reported by Ralf Meyer).  Also corrected the
  description of INFO and the test on ITYPE. Sven, 16 Feb 05.
