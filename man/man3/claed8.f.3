\fBCLAED8\fP used by sstedc\&. Merges eigenvalues and deflates secular equation\&. Used when the original matrix is dense\&.  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CLAED8 merges the two sets of eigenvalues together into a single
 sorted set.  Then it tries to deflate the size of the problem.
 There are two ways in which deflation can occur:  when two or more
 eigenvalues are close together or if there is a tiny element in the
 Z vector.  For each such occurrence the order of the related secular
 equation problem is reduced by one.

         Contains the off diagonal element associated with the rank-1
         cut which originally split the two submatrices which are now
         being recombined. RHO is modified during the computation to
         the value required by SLAED3.
