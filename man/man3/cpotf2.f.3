\fBCPOTF2\fP computes the Cholesky factorization of a symmetric/Hermitian positive definite matrix (unblocked algorithm)\&.  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CPOTF2 computes the Cholesky factorization of a complex Hermitian
 positive definite matrix A.

 The factorization has the form
    A = U**H * U ,  if UPLO = 'U', or
    A = L  * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
 where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

 This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
          Hermitian matrix A is stored.
          = 'U':  Upper triangular
          = 'L':  Lower triangular

          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

\fIA\fP

.nf
          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
          n by n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
          leading n by n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
          triangular part of A is not referenced.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
          factorization A = U**H *U  or A = L*L**H.
