 DSYGST reduces a real symmetric-definite generalized eigenproblem
 to standard form.

 If ITYPE = 1, the problem is A*x = lambda*B*x,
 and A is overwritten by inv(U**T)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**T)

 If ITYPE = 2 or 3, the problem is A*B*x = lambda*x or
 B*A*x = lambda*x, and A is overwritten by U*A*U**T or L**T*A*L.

 B must have been previously factorized as U**T*U or L*L**T by DPOTRF.
