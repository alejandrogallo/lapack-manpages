.PP

.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 ZGEEVX computes for an N-by-N complex nonsymmetric matrix A, the
 eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors.

 Optionally also, it computes a balancing transformation to improve
 the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (ILO, IHI,
 SCALE, and ABNRM), reciprocal condition numbers for the eigenvalues
 (RCONDE), and reciprocal condition numbers for the right
 eigenvectors (RCONDV).

 The right eigenvector v(j) of A satisfies
                  A * v(j) = lambda(j) * v(j)
 where lambda(j) is its eigenvalue.
 The left eigenvector u(j) of A satisfies
               u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H
 where u(j)**H denotes the conjugate transpose of u(j).

 The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm
 equal to 1 and largest component real.

 Balancing a matrix means permuting the rows and columns to make it
 more nearly upper triangular, and applying a diagonal similarity
 transformation D * A * D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix, to
 make its rows and columns closer in norm and the condition numbers
 of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors smaller.  The computed
 reciprocal condition numbers correspond to the balanced matrix.
 Permuting rows and columns will not change the condition numbers
 (in exact arithmetic) but diagonal scaling will.  For further
 explanation of balancing, see section 4.10.2 of the LAPACK
 Users' Guide.

\fIBALANC\fP 
.PP
.nf
          BALANC is CHARACTER*1
          Indicates how the input matrix should be diagonally scaled
          and/or permuted to improve the conditioning of its
          eigenvalues.
          = 'N': Do not diagonally scale or permute;
          = 'P': Perform permutations to make the matrix more nearly
                 upper triangular. Do not diagonally scale;
          = 'S': Diagonally scale the matrix, ie. replace A by
                 D*A*D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix chosen
                 to make the rows and columns of A more equal in
                 norm. Do not permute;
          = 'B': Both diagonally scale and permute A.

          Computed reciprocal condition numbers will be for the matrix
          after balancing and/or permuting. Permuting does not change
          condition numbers (in exact arithmetic), but balancing does.

          interchanged with row and column j, and D(j) is the scaling
          factor applied to row and column j, then

          For good performance, LWORK must generally be larger.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
