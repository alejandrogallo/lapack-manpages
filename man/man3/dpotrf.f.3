.PP
.nf
 DPOTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
 positive definite matrix A.

 The factorization has the form
    A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
    A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
 where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

 This is the block version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

.nf
          A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
          triangular part of A is not referenced.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T.
