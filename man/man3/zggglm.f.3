 ZGGGLM solves a general Gauss-Markov linear model (GLM) problem:

         minimize || y ||_2   subject to   d = A*x + B*y
             x

 where A is an N-by-M matrix, B is an N-by-P matrix, and d is a
 given N-vector. It is assumed that M <= N <= M+P, and

            rank(A) = M    and    rank( A B ) = N.

 Under these assumptions, the constrained equation is always
 consistent, and there is a unique solution x and a minimal 2-norm
 solution y, which is obtained using a generalized QR factorization
 of the matrices (A, B) given by

    A = Q*(R),   B = Q*T*Z.
          (0)

 In particular, if matrix B is square nonsingular, then the problem
 GLM is equivalent to the following weighted linear least squares
 problem

              minimize || inv(B)*(d-A*x) ||_2
                  x

 where inv(B) denotes the inverse of B.
