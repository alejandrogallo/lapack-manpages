.PP
.nf
 CPPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
 1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite packed matrix using
 the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H computed by
 CPPTRF.

 An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
 condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIAP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          AP is COMPLEX array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
          A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, packed columnwise in a linear
          array.  The j-th column of U or L is stored in the array AP
          as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = U(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = L(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

.nf
          ANORM is REAL
          The 1-norm (or infinity-norm) of the Hermitian matrix A.

\fIRCOND\fP 
.PP
.nf
          RCOND is REAL
          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
