.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 ZPTTRF computes the L*D*L**H factorization of a complex Hermitian
 positive definite tridiagonal matrix A.  The factorization may also
 be regarded as having the form A = U**H *D*U.

.nf
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

\fID\fP 
.PP
.nf
          D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
          On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
          A.  On exit, the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix
          D from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.

\fIE\fP 
.PP
.nf
          E is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
          On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
          matrix A.  On exit, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the
          unit bidiagonal factor L from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.
          E can also be regarded as the superdiagonal of the unit
          bidiagonal factor U from the U**H *D*U factorization of A.

\fIINFO\fP

.nf
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0: successful exit
          < 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0: if INFO = k, the leading minor of order k is not
               positive definite; if k < N, the factorization could not
               be completed, while if k = N, the factorization was
               completed, but D(N) <= 0.
