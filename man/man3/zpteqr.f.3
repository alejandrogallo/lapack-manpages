.nf
 ZPTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
 symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix by first factoring the
 matrix using DPTTRF and then calling ZBDSQR to compute the singular
 values of the bidiagonal factor.

 This routine computes the eigenvalues of the positive definite
 tridiagonal matrix to high relative accuracy.  This means that if the
 eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude in size, then the
 small eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors will be computed
 more accurately than, for example, with the standard QR method.

 The eigenvectors of a full or band positive definite Hermitian matrix
 can also be found if ZHETRD, ZHPTRD, or ZHBTRD has been used to
 reduce this matrix to tridiagonal form.  (The reduction to
 tridiagonal form, however, may preclude the possibility of obtaining
 high relative accuracy in the small eigenvalues of the original
 matrix, if these eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude.)

          COMPZ is CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only.

                  matrix also.  Array Z contains the unitary matrix
                  used to reduce the original matrix to tridiagonal
                  form.
