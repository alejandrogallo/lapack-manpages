\fBDLAED2\fP used by sstedc\&. Merges eigenvalues and deflates secular equation\&. Used when the original matrix is tridiagonal\&.  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 DLAED2 merges the two sets of eigenvalues together into a single
 sorted set.  Then it tries to deflate the size of the problem.
 There are two ways in which deflation can occur:  when two or more
 eigenvalues are close together or if there is a tiny entry in the
 Z vector.  For each such occurrence the order of the related secular
 equation problem is reduced by one.

          D is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
         On entry, D contains the eigenvalues of the two submatrices to
         be combined.

         (those which were deflated) sorted into increasing order.

         On entry, Q contains the eigenvectors of two submatrices in
         the two square blocks with corners at (1,1), (N1,N1)
         and (N1+1, N1+1), (N,N).

         (those which were deflated) in its last N-K columns.

\fIINDXQ\fP 
.PP
.nf
          INDXQ is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The permutation which separately sorts the two sub-problems
         in D into ascending order.  Note that elements in the second
         half of this permutation must first have N1 added to their
         values. Destroyed on exit.

          RHO is DOUBLE PRECISION
         On entry, the off-diagonal element associated with the rank-1
         cut which originally split the two submatrices which are now
         being recombined.
         On exit, RHO has been modified to the value required by
         DLAED3.

         row of the first sub-eigenvector matrix and the first row of
         the second sub-eigenvector matrix).

.PP
.nf
          INDXC is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The permutation used to arrange the columns of the deflated
         Q matrix into three groups:  the first group contains non-zero
         elements only at and above N1, the second contains
         non-zero elements only below N1, and the third is dense.

\fIINDXP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          INDXP is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
         The permutation used to place deflated values of D at the end
         of the array.  INDXP(1:K) points to the nondeflated D-values
         and INDXP(K+1:N) points to the deflated eigenvalues.

         1 : non-zero in the upper half only;
         2 : dense;
         3 : non-zero in the lower half only;
         4 : deflated.
