.nf
 SPTEQR computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
 symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix by first factoring the
 matrix using SPTTRF, and then calling SBDSQR to compute the singular
 values of the bidiagonal factor.

 This routine computes the eigenvalues of the positive definite
 tridiagonal matrix to high relative accuracy.  This means that if the
 eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude in size, then the
 small eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors will be computed
 more accurately than, for example, with the standard QR method.

 The eigenvectors of a full or band symmetric positive definite matrix
 can also be found if SSYTRD, SSPTRD, or SSBTRD has been used to
 reduce this matrix to tridiagonal form. (The reduction to tridiagonal
 form, however, may preclude the possibility of obtaining high
 relative accuracy in the small eigenvalues of the original matrix, if
 these eigenvalues range over many orders of magnitude.)

                  matrix also.  Array Z contains the orthogonal
                  matrix used to reduce the original matrix to
                  tridiagonal form.
