 ZTGSY2 solves the generalized Sylvester equation

             A * R - L * B = scale * C               (1)
             D * R - L * E = scale * F

 using Level 1 and 2 BLAS, where R and L are unknown M-by-N matrices,
 (A, D), (B, E) and (C, F) are given matrix pairs of size M-by-M,
 N-by-N and M-by-N, respectively. A, B, D and E are upper triangular
 (i.e., (A,D) and (B,E) in generalized Schur form).

 The solution (R, L) overwrites (C, F). 0 <= SCALE <= 1 is an output
 scaling factor chosen to avoid overflow.

 In matrix notation solving equation (1) corresponds to solve
 Zx = scale * b, where Z is defined as

        Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B**H, Im) ]             (2)
            [ kron(In, D)  -kron(E**H, Im) ],

 Ik is the identity matrix of size k and X**H is the conjuguate transpose of X.
 kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.

 If TRANS = 'C', y in the conjugate transposed system Z**H*y = scale*b
 is solved for, which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

             A**H * R  + D**H * L   = scale * C           (3)
             R  * B**H + L  * E**H  = scale * -F

 This case is used to compute an estimate of Dif[(A, D), (B, E)] =
 = sigma_min(Z) using reverse communicaton with ZLACON.

 ZTGSY2 also (IJOB >= 1) contributes to the computation in ZTGSYL
 of an upper bound on the separation between to matrix pairs. Then
 the input (A, D), (B, E) are sub-pencils of two matrix pairs in
 ZTGSYL.
