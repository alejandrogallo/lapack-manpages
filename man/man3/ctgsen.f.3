.nf
 CTGSEN reorders the generalized Schur decomposition of a complex
 matrix pair (A, B) (in terms of an unitary equivalence trans-
 formation Q**H * (A, B) * Z), so that a selected cluster of eigenvalues
 appears in the leading diagonal blocks of the pair (A,B). The leading
 columns of Q and Z form unitary bases of the corresponding left and
 right eigenspaces (deflating subspaces). (A, B) must be in
 generalized Schur canonical form, that is, A and B are both upper
 triangular.

 CTGSEN also computes the generalized eigenvalues

          w(j)= ALPHA(j) / BETA(j)

 of the reordered matrix pair (A, B).

 Optionally, the routine computes estimates of reciprocal condition
 numbers for eigenvalues and eigenspaces. These are Difu[(A11,B11),
 (A22,B22)] and Difl[(A11,B11), (A22,B22)], i.e. the separation(s)
 between the matrix pairs (A11, B11) and (A22,B22) that correspond to
 the selected cluster and the eigenvalues outside the cluster, resp.,
 and norms of "projections" onto left and right eigenspaces w.r.t.
 the selected cluster in the (1,1)-block.

  CTGSEN first collects the selected eigenvalues by computing unitary
  U and W that move them to the top left corner of (A, B). In other
  words, the selected eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of (A11, B11) in

              U**H*(A, B)*W = (A11 A12) (B11 B12) n1
                              ( 0  A22),( 0  B22) n2
                                n1  n2    n1  n2

  where N = n1+n2 and U**H means the conjugate transpose of U. The first
  n1 columns of U and W span the specified pair of left and right
  eigenspaces (deflating subspaces) of (A, B).

  If (A, B) has been obtained from the generalized real Schur
  decomposition of a matrix pair (C, D) = Q*(A, B)*Z', then the
  reordered generalized Schur form of (C, D) is given by

           (C, D) = (Q*U)*(U**H *(A, B)*W)*(Z*W)**H,

  and the first n1 columns of Q*U and Z*W span the corresponding
  deflating subspaces of (C, D) (Q and Z store Q*U and Z*W, resp.).

  Note that if the selected eigenvalue is sufficiently ill-conditioned,
  then its value may differ significantly from its value before
  reordering.

  The reciprocal condition numbers of the left and right eigenspaces
  spanned by the first n1 columns of U and W (or Q*U and Z*W) may
  be returned in DIF(1:2), corresponding to Difu and Difl, resp.

  The Difu and Difl are defined as:

       Difu[(A11, B11), (A22, B22)] = sigma-min( Zu )
  and
       Difl[(A11, B11), (A22, B22)] = Difu[(A22, B22), (A11, B11)],

  where sigma-min(Zu) is the smallest singular value of the
  (2*n1*n2)-by-(2*n1*n2) matrix

       Zu = [ kron(In2, A11)  -kron(A22**H, In1) ]
            [ kron(In2, B11)  -kron(B22**H, In1) ].

  Here, Inx is the identity matrix of size nx and A22**H is the
  conjuguate transpose of A22. kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between
  the matrices X and Y.

  When DIF(2) is small, small changes in (A, B) can cause large changes
  in the deflating subspace. An approximate (asymptotic) bound on the
  maximum angular error in the computed deflating subspaces is

       EPS * norm((A, B)) / DIF(2),

  where EPS is the machine precision.

  The reciprocal norm of the projectors on the left and right
  eigenspaces associated with (A11, B11) may be returned in PL and PR.
  They are computed as follows. First we compute L and R so that
  P*(A, B)*Q is block diagonal, where

       P = ( I -L ) n1           Q = ( I R ) n1
           ( 0  I ) n2    and        ( 0 I ) n2
             n1 n2                    n1 n2

  and (L, R) is the solution to the generalized Sylvester equation

       A11*R - L*A22 = -A12
       B11*R - L*B22 = -B12

  Then PL = (F-norm(L)**2+1)**(-1/2) and PR = (F-norm(R)**2+1)**(-1/2).
  An approximate (asymptotic) bound on the average absolute error of
  the selected eigenvalues is

       EPS * norm((A, B)) / PL.

  There are also global error bounds which valid for perturbations up
  to a certain restriction:  A lower bound (x) on the smallest
  F-norm(E,F) for which an eigenvalue of (A11, B11) may move and
  coalesce with an eigenvalue of (A22, B22) under perturbation (E,F),
  (i.e. (A + E, B + F), is

   x = min(Difu,Difl)/((1/(PL*PL)+1/(PR*PR))**(1/2)+2*max(1/PL,1/PR)).

  An approximate bound on x can be computed from DIF(1:2), PL and PR.

  If y = ( F-norm(E,F) / x) <= 1, the angles between the perturbed
  (L', R') and unperturbed (L, R) left and right deflating subspaces
  associated with the selected cluster in the (1,1)-blocks can be
  bounded as

   max-angle(L, L') <= arctan( y * PL / (1 - y * (1 - PL * PL)**(1/2))
   max-angle(R, R') <= arctan( y * PR / (1 - y * (1 - PR * PR)**(1/2))

  See LAPACK User's Guide section 4.11 or the following references
  for more information.

  Note that if the default method for computing the Frobenius-norm-
  based estimate DIF is not wanted (see CLATDF), then the parameter
  IDIFJB (see below) should be changed from 3 to 4 (routine CLATDF
  (IJOB = 2 will be used)). See CTGSYL for more details.
