.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SSPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
 1-norm) of a real symmetric packed matrix A using the factorization
 A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by SSPTRF.

 An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
 condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIAP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          AP is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
          obtain the factor U or L as computed by SSPTRF, stored as a
          packed triangular matrix.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIIPIV\fP 
.PP
.nf
          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
          as determined by SSPTRF.

\fIRCOND\fP 
.PP
.nf
          RCOND is REAL
          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
