\fB ZPBSVX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for OTHER matrices\fP  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 ZPBSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H to
 compute the solution to a complex system of linear equations
    A * X = B,
 where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite band matrix and X
 and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
 provided.

\fBDescription: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 The following steps are performed:

 1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
    the system:
       diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
    Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
    scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
    overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

 2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
    factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
       A = U**H * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
       A = L * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
    where U is an upper triangular band matrix, and L is a lower
    triangular band matrix.

 3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
    then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
    form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
    A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
    precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
    still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
    described below.

 4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

 5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
    matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
    for it.

 6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
    diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
    equilibration.

          If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
          is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
          element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
          largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
          the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight

          > 0: if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
                       not positive definite, so the factorization
                       could not be completed, and the solution has not
                       been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.

  The band storage scheme is illustrated by the following example, when
  N = 6, KD = 2, and UPLO = 'U':

  Two-dimensional storage of the Hermitian matrix A:

     a11  a12  a13
          a22  a23  a24
               a33  a34  a35
                    a44  a45  a46
                         a55  a56
     (aij=conjg(aji))         a66

  Band storage of the upper triangle of A:

      *    *   a13  a24  a35  a46
      *   a12  a23  a34  a45  a56
     a11  a22  a33  a44  a55  a66

  Similarly, if UPLO = 'L' the format of A is as follows:

     a11  a22  a33  a44  a55  a66
     a21  a32  a43  a54  a65   *
     a31  a42  a53  a64   *    *

  Array elements marked * are not used by the routine.
