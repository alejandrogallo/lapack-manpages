.nf
 SGSVJ1 is called from SGESVJ as a pre-processor and that is its main
 purpose. It applies Jacobi rotations in the same way as SGESVJ does, but
 it targets only particular pivots and it does not check convergence
 (stopping criterion). Few tunning parameters (marked by [TP]) are
 available for the implementer.

 Further Details
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 SGSVJ1 applies few sweeps of Jacobi rotations in the column space of
 the input M-by-N matrix A. The pivot pairs are taken from the (1,2)
 off-diagonal block in the corresponding N-by-N Gram matrix A^T * A. The
 block-entries (tiles) of the (1,2) off-diagonal block are marked by the
 [x]'s in the following scheme:

    | *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|
    | *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|    Row-cycling in the nblr-by-nblc [x] blocks.
    | *  *  * [x] [x] [x]|    Row-cyclic pivoting inside each [x] block.
    |[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |
    |[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |
    |[x] [x] [x] *  *  * |

 In terms of the columns of A, the first N1 columns are rotated 'against'
 the remaining N-N1 columns, trying to increase the angle between the
 corresponding subspaces. The off-diagonal block is N1-by(N-N1) and it is
 tiled using quadratic tiles of side KBL. Here, KBL is a tunning parmeter.
 The number of sweeps is given in NSWEEP and the orthogonality threshold
 is given in TOL.
