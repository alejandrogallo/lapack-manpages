          written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal

  If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H

  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
  v(i+1:n) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in
  A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau in TAU(i).

  If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H

  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
  v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in A(i+2:n,i),
  and tau in TAU(i).

  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
  with n = 5:

  if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':

    (  d   e   v2  v3  v4 )              (  d                  )
    (      d   e   v3  v4 )              (  e   d              )
    (          d   e   v4 )              (  v1  e   d          )
    (              d   e  )              (  v1  v2  e   d      )
    (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  v3  e   d  )

  where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of T, and vi
  denotes an element of the vector defining H(i).
