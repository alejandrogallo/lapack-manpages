.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 STRMM  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations

    B := alpha*op( A )*B,   or   B := alpha*B*op( A ),

 where  alpha  is a scalar,  B  is an m by n matrix,  A  is a unit, or
 non-unit,  upper or lower triangular matrix  and  op( A )  is one  of

    op( A ) = A   or   op( A ) = A**T.

\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fISIDE\fP 
.PP
.nf
          SIDE is CHARACTER*1
           On entry,  SIDE specifies whether  op( A ) multiplies B from
           the left or right as follows:

              SIDE = 'L' or 'l'   B := alpha*op( A )*B.

              SIDE = 'R' or 'r'   B := alpha*B*op( A ).
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix A is an upper or
           lower triangular matrix as follows:

              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.

              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fITRANSA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          TRANSA is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, TRANSA specifies the form of op( A ) to be used in
           the matrix multiplication as follows:

              TRANSA = 'N' or 'n'   op( A ) = A.

              TRANSA = 'T' or 't'   op( A ) = A**T.

              TRANSA = 'C' or 'c'   op( A ) = A**T.
.fi
.PP

\fIDIAG\fP 
.PP
.nf
          DIAG is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit triangular
           as follows:

              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.

              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
                                  triangular.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIM\fP 
.PP
.nf
          M is INTEGER
           On entry, M specifies the number of rows of B. M must be at
           least zero.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
           On entry, N specifies the number of columns of B.  N must be
           at least zero.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIALPHA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          ALPHA is REAL
           On entry,  ALPHA specifies the scalar  alpha. When  alpha is
           zero then  A is not referenced and  B need not be set before
           entry.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is REAL array, dimension ( LDA, k ), where k is m
           when  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  and is  n  when  SIDE = 'R' or 'r'.
           Before entry  with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u',  the  leading  k by k
           upper triangular part of the array  A must contain the upper
           triangular matrix  and the strictly lower triangular part of
           A is not referenced.
           Before entry  with  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',  the  leading  k by k
           lower triangular part of the array  A must contain the lower
           triangular matrix  and the strictly upper triangular part of
           A is not referenced.
           Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u',  the diagonal elements of
           A  are not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.

\fILDA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDA is INTEGER
           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
           in the calling (sub) program.  When  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  then
           LDA  must be at least  max( 1, m ),  when  SIDE = 'R' or 'r'
           then LDA must be at least max( 1, n ).
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIB\fP 
.PP
.nf
          B is REAL array, dimension ( LDB, N )
           Before entry,  the leading  m by n part of the array  B must
           contain the matrix  B,  and  on exit  is overwritten  by the
           transformed matrix.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fILDB\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDB is INTEGER
           On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared
           in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDB  must  be  at  least
           max( 1, m ).
