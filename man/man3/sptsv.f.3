.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SPTSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
 A*X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite tridiagonal
 matrix, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 A is factored as A = L*D*L**T, and the factored form of A is then
 used to solve the system of equations.

\fINRHS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          NRHS is INTEGER

\fID\fP 
.PP
.nf
          D is REAL array, dimension (N)
          On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
          A.  On exit, the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix

.nf
          E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
          On entry, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
          matrix A.  On exit, the (n-1) subdiagonal elements of the
          unit bidiagonal factor L from the L*D*L**T factorization of
          A.  (E can also be regarded as the superdiagonal of the unit

                computed.  The factorization has not been completed
                unless i = N.
