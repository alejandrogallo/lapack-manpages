 ZTGSYL solves the generalized Sylvester equation:

             A * R - L * B = scale * C            (1)
             D * R - L * E = scale * F

 where R and L are unknown m-by-n matrices, (A, D), (B, E) and
 (C, F) are given matrix pairs of size m-by-m, n-by-n and m-by-n,
 respectively, with complex entries. A, B, D and E are upper
 triangular (i.e., (A,D) and (B,E) in generalized Schur form).

 The solution (R, L) overwrites (C, F). 0 <= SCALE <= 1
 is an output scaling factor chosen to avoid overflow.

 In matrix notation (1) is equivalent to solve Zx = scale*b, where Z
 is defined as

        Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B**H, Im) ]        (2)
            [ kron(In, D)  -kron(E**H, Im) ],

 Here Ix is the identity matrix of size x and X**H is the conjugate
 transpose of X. Kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the
 matrices X and Y.

 If TRANS = 'C', y in the conjugate transposed system Z**H *y = scale*b
 is solved for, which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

             A**H * R + D**H * L = scale * C           (3)
             R * B**H + L * E**H = scale * -F

 This case (TRANS = 'C') is used to compute an one-norm-based estimate
 of Dif[(A,D), (B,E)], the separation between the matrix pairs (A,D)
 and (B,E), using ZLACON.

 If IJOB >= 1, ZTGSYL computes a Frobenius norm-based estimate of
 Dif[(A,D),(B,E)]. That is, the reciprocal of a lower bound on the
 reciprocal of the smallest singular value of Z.

 This is a level-3 BLAS algorithm.
