 SSTEBZ computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal
 matrix T.  The user may ask for all eigenvalues, all eigenvalues
 in the half-open interval (VL, VU], or the IL-th through IU-th
 eigenvalues.

 To avoid overflow, the matrix must be scaled so that its
 largest element is no greater than overflow**(1/2) * underflow**(1/4) in absolute value, and for greatest
 accuracy, it should not be much smaller than that.

 See W. Kahan "Accurate Eigenvalues of a Symmetric Tridiagonal
 Matrix", Report CS41, Computer Science Dept., Stanford
 University, July 21, 1966.

\fIABSTOL\fP 
.PP
.nf
          ABSTOL is REAL
          The absolute tolerance for the eigenvalues.  An eigenvalue
          (or cluster) is considered to be located if it has been
          determined to lie in an interval whose width is ABSTOL or
          less.  If ABSTOL is less than or equal to zero, then ULP*|T|
          will be used, where |T| means the 1-norm of T.

          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*SLAMCH('S'), not zero.

\fIIBLOCK\fP

          IBLOCK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          At each row/column j where E(j) is zero or small, the
          matrix T is considered to split into a block diagonal
          matrix.  On exit, if INFO = 0, IBLOCK(i) specifies to which
          block (from 1 to the number of blocks) the eigenvalue W(i)
          belongs.  (SSTEBZ may use the remaining N-M elements as
          workspace.)

\fIISPLIT\fP

.nf
          ISPLIT is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          The splitting points, at which T breaks up into submatrices.
          The first submatrix consists of rows/columns 1 to ISPLIT(1),
          the second of rows/columns ISPLIT(1)+1 through ISPLIT(2),
          etc., and the NSPLIT-th consists of rows/columns
          ISPLIT(NSPLIT-1)+1 through ISPLIT(NSPLIT)=N.
          (Only the first NSPLIT elements will actually be used, but
          since the user cannot know a priori what value NSPLIT will
          have, N words must be reserved for ISPLIT.)

          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  some or all of the eigenvalues failed to converge or
                were not computed:
                =1 or 3: Bisection failed to converge for some
                        eigenvalues; these eigenvalues are flagged by a
                        negative block number.  The effect is that the
                        eigenvalues may not be as accurate as the
                        absolute and relative tolerances.  This is
                        generally caused by unexpectedly inaccurate
                        arithmetic.
                =2 or 3: RANGE='I' only: Not all of the eigenvalues
                        IL:IU were found.
                        Effect: M < IU+1-IL
                        Cause:  non-monotonic arithmetic, causing the
                                Sturm sequence to be non-monotonic.
                        Cure:   recalculate, using RANGE='A', and pick
                                out eigenvalues IL:IU.  In some cases,
                                increasing the PARAMETER "FUDGE" may
                                make things work.
                = 4:    RANGE='I', and the Gershgorin interval
                        initially used was too small.  No eigenvalues
                        were computed.
                        Probable cause: your machine has sloppy
                                        floating-point arithmetic.
                        Cure: Increase the PARAMETER "FUDGE",
                              recompile, and try again.

  RELFAC  REAL, default = 2.0e0
          The relative tolerance.  An interval (a,b] lies within
          "relative tolerance" if  b-a < RELFAC*ulp*max(|a|,|b|),
          where "ulp" is the machine precision (distance from 1 to
          the next larger floating point number.)

  FUDGE   REAL, default = 2
          A "fudge factor" to widen the Gershgorin intervals.  Ideally,
          a value of 1 should work, but on machines with sloppy
          arithmetic, this needs to be larger.  The default for
          publicly released versions should be large enough to handle
          the worst machine around.  Note that this has no effect
          on accuracy of the solution.
