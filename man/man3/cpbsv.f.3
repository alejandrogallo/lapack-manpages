.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CPBSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations
    A * X = B,
 where A is an N-by-N Hermitian positive definite band matrix and X
 and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as
    A = U**H * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
    A = L * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
 where U is an upper triangular band matrix, and L is a lower
 triangular band matrix, with the same number of superdiagonals or
 subdiagonals as A.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the
 system of equations A * X = B.

          UPLO is CHARACTER*1

          KD is INTEGER
          The number of superdiagonals of the matrix A if UPLO = 'U',

.nf
          AB is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAB,N)
          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian band
          matrix A, stored in the first KD+1 rows of the array.  The
          j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB
          as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AB(KD+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-KD)<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AB(1+i-j,j)    = A(i,j) for j<=i<=min(N,j+KD).
          See below for further details.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the triangular factor U or L from the
          Cholesky factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H of the band
          matrix A, in the same storage format as A.

          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i of A is not
                positive definite, so the factorization could not be
                completed, and the solution has not been computed.

  The band storage scheme is illustrated by the following example, when
  N = 6, KD = 2, and UPLO = 'U':

  On entry:                       On exit:

      *    *   a13  a24  a35  a46      *    *   u13  u24  u35  u46
      *   a12  a23  a34  a45  a56      *   u12  u23  u34  u45  u56
     a11  a22  a33  a44  a55  a66     u11  u22  u33  u44  u55  u66

  Similarly, if UPLO = 'L' the format of A is as follows:

  On entry:                       On exit:

     a11  a22  a33  a44  a55  a66     l11  l22  l33  l44  l55  l66
     a21  a32  a43  a54  a65   *      l21  l32  l43  l54  l65   *
     a31  a42  a53  a64   *    *      l31  l42  l53  l64   *    *

  Array elements marked * are not used by the routine.
