.nf
 CTRTRS solves a triangular system of the form

    A * X = B,  A**T * X = B,  or  A**H * X = B,

 where A is a triangular matrix of order N, and B is an N-by-NRHS
 matrix.  A check is made to verify that A is nonsingular.

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
          = 'L':  A is lower triangular.

\fITRANS\fP

.nf
          TRANS is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the form of the system of equations:
          = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
          = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
          = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose)

          DIAG is CHARACTER*1
          = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;

\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

\fINRHS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          NRHS is INTEGER
          The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
          of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
.fi

\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
          The triangular matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
          upper triangular part of the array A contains the upper
          triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of
          A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
          triangular part of the array A contains the lower triangular
          matrix, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is not
          referenced.  If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are
          also not referenced and are assumed to be 1.

\fIB\fP 
.PP
.nf
          B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
          On entry, the right hand side matrix B.

          INFO is INTEGER

          < 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0: if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element of A is zero,
               indicating that the matrix is singular and the solutions
               X have not been computed.
