 ZGEBAL balances a general complex matrix A.  This involves, first,
 permuting A by a similarity transformation to isolate eigenvalues
 in the first 1 to ILO-1 and last IHI+1 to N elements on the
 diagonal; and second, applying a diagonal similarity transformation
 to rows and columns ILO to IHI to make the rows and columns as
 close in norm as possible.  Both steps are optional.

 Balancing may reduce the 1-norm of the matrix, and improve the
 accuracy of the computed eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors.

.nf
          JOB is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies the operations to be performed on A:
          = 'N':  none:  simply set ILO = 1, IHI = N, SCALE(I) = 1.0
                  for i = 1,...,N;
          = 'P':  permute only;
          = 'S':  scale only;
          = 'B':  both permute and scale.

          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

\fIA\fP

.nf
          A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the input matrix A.
          On exit,  A is overwritten by the balanced matrix.
          If JOB = 'N', A is not referenced.

          IHI is INTEGER

.nf
          SCALE is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
          Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied to
          A.  If P(j) is the index of the row and column interchanged
          with row and column j and D(j) is the scaling factor
          applied to row and column j, then
          SCALE(j) = P(j)    for j = 1,...,ILO-1
                   = D(j)    for j = ILO,...,IHI
                   = P(j)    for j = IHI+1,...,N.
          The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
          then 1 to ILO-1.

  The permutations consist of row and column interchanges which put
  the matrix in the form

             ( T1   X   Y  )
     P A P = (  0   B   Z  )
             (  0   0   T2 )

  where T1 and T2 are upper triangular matrices whose eigenvalues lie
  along the diagonal.  The column indices ILO and IHI mark the starting
  and ending columns of the submatrix B. Balancing consists of applying
  a diagonal similarity transformation inv(D) * B * D to make the
  1-norms of each row of B and its corresponding column nearly equal.
  The output matrix is

     ( T1     X*D          Y    )
     (  0  inv(D)*B*D  inv(D)*Z ).
     (  0      0           T2   )

  Information about the permutations P and the diagonal matrix D is
  returned in the vector SCALE.

  This subroutine is based on the EISPACK routine CBAL.
