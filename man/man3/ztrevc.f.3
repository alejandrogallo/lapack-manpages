 ZTREVC computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
 a complex upper triangular matrix T.
 Matrices of this type are produced by the Schur factorization of
 a complex general matrix:  A = Q*T*Q**H, as computed by ZHSEQR.

 The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of T corresponding
 to an eigenvalue w are defined by:

              T*x = w*x,     (y**H)*T = w*(y**H)

 where y**H denotes the conjugate transpose of the vector y.
 The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are read directly
 from the diagonal of T.

 This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
 eigenvectors of T, or the products Q*X and/or Q*Y, where Q is an
 input matrix.  If Q is the unitary factor that reduces a matrix A to
 Schur form T, then Q*X and Q*Y are the matrices of right and left
 eigenvectors of A.

  The algorithm used in this program is basically backward (forward)
  substitution, with scaling to make the the code robust against
  possible overflow.

  Each eigenvector is normalized so that the element of largest
  magnitude has magnitude 1; here the magnitude of a complex number
  (x,y) is taken to be |x| + |y|.
