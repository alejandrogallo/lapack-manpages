\fB SPOSV computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for PO matrices\fP  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SPOSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
    A * X = B,
 where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B
 are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as
    A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
    A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
 where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
 matrix.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of
 equations A * X = B.

          N is INTEGER

          NRHS is INTEGER

.nf
          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
          triangular part of A is not referenced.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
          factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T.

          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i of A is not
                positive definite, so the factorization could not be
                completed, and the solution has not been computed.
