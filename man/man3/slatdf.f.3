.PP
\fBSLATDF\fP uses the LU factorization of the n-by-n matrix computed by sgetc2 and computes a contribution to the reciprocal Dif-estimate\&.  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SLATDF uses the LU factorization of the n-by-n matrix Z computed by
 SGETC2 and computes a contribution to the reciprocal Dif-estimate
 by solving Z * x = b for x, and choosing the r.h.s. b such that
 the norm of x is as large as possible. On entry RHS = b holds the
 contribution from earlier solved sub-systems, and on return RHS = x.

 The factorization of Z returned by SGETC2 has the form Z = P*L*U*Q,
 where P and Q are permutation matrices. L is lower triangular with
 unit diagonal elements and U is upper triangular.

\fIIJOB\fP 
.PP
.nf
          IJOB is INTEGER
          IJOB = 2: First compute an approximative null-vector e
              of Z using SGECON, e is normalized and solve for
              Zx = +-e - f with the sign giving the greater value
              of 2-norm(x). About 5 times as expensive as Default.
          IJOB .ne. 2: Local look ahead strategy where all entries of
              the r.h.s. b is chosen as either +1 or -1 (Default).

.br
\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
          The number of columns of the matrix Z.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIZ\fP 
.PP
.nf
          Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ, N)
          On entry, the LU part of the factorization of the n-by-n
          matrix Z computed by SGETC2:  Z = P * L * U * Q
.fi
.PP
.br
\fILDZ\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDZ is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDA >= max(1, N).
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIRHS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          RHS is REAL array, dimension N.
          On entry, RHS contains contributions from other subsystems.
          On exit, RHS contains the solution of the subsystem with
          entries acoording to the value of IJOB (see above).
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIRDSUM\fP 
.PP
.nf
          RDSUM is REAL
          On entry, the sum of squares of computed contributions to
          the Dif-estimate under computation by STGSYL, where the
          scaling factor RDSCAL (see below) has been factored out.
          On exit, the corresponding sum of squares updated with the
          contributions from the current sub-system.
          If TRANS = 'T' RDSUM is not touched.
          NOTE: RDSUM only makes sense when STGSY2 is called by STGSYL.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIRDSCAL\fP 
.PP
.nf
          RDSCAL is REAL
          On entry, scaling factor used to prevent overflow in RDSUM.
          On exit, RDSCAL is updated w.r.t. the current contributions
          in RDSUM.
          If TRANS = 'T', RDSCAL is not touched.
          NOTE: RDSCAL only makes sense when STGSY2 is called by
                STGSYL.

\fIIPIV\fP 
.PP
.nf
          IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N).
          The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the
          matrix has been interchanged with row IPIV(i).

\fIJPIV\fP 
.PP
.nf
          JPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N).
          The pivot indices; for 1 <= j <= N, column j of the
          matrix has been interchanged with column JPIV(j).
