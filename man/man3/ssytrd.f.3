          A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
          On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
          N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
          triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
          leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
          triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
          triangular part of A is not referenced.
          On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the diagonal and first superdiagonal
          of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
          tridiagonal matrix T, and the elements above the first
          superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the orthogonal
          matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
          = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
          written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal
          matrix T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with
          the array TAU, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product
          of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.

          optimal blocksize.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

  If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T

  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(i+1:n) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in
  A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau in TAU(i).

  If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T

  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in A(i+2:n,i),
  and tau in TAU(i).

  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
  with n = 5:

  if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':

    (  d   e   v2  v3  v4 )              (  d                  )
    (      d   e   v3  v4 )              (  e   d              )
    (          d   e   v4 )              (  v1  e   d          )
    (              d   e  )              (  v1  v2  e   d      )
    (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  v3  e   d  )

  where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of T, and vi
  denotes an element of the vector defining H(i).
