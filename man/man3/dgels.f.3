.nf
 DGELS solves overdetermined or underdetermined real linear systems
 involving an M-by-N matrix A, or its transpose, using a QR or LQ
 factorization of A.  It is assumed that A has full rank.

 The following options are provided:

 1. If TRANS = 'N' and m >= n:  find the least squares solution of
    an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                 minimize || B - A*X ||.

 2. If TRANS = 'N' and m < n:  find the minimum norm solution of
    an underdetermined system A * X = B.

 3. If TRANS = 'T' and m >= n:  find the minimum norm solution of
    an underdetermined system A**T * X = B.

 4. If TRANS = 'T' and m < n:  find the least squares solution of
    an overdetermined system, i.e., solve the least squares problem
                 minimize || B - A**T * X ||.

 Several right hand side vectors b and solution vectors x can be
 handled in a single call; they are stored as the columns of the
 M-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B and the N-by-NRHS solution
 matrix X.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, B is overwritten by the solution
          vectors, stored columnwise:
          if TRANS = 'N' and m >= n, rows 1 to n of B contain the least
          squares solution vectors; the residual sum of squares for the

          LWORK is INTEGER
          The dimension of the array WORK.
          LWORK >= max( 1, MN + max( MN, NRHS ) ).
          For optimal performance,
          LWORK >= max( 1, MN + max( MN, NRHS )*NB ).
          where MN = min(M,N) and NB is the optimum block size.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

          > 0:  if INFO =  i, the i-th diagonal element of the
                triangular factor of A is zero, so that A does not have
                full rank; the least squares solution could not be
                computed.
