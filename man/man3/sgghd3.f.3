 SGGHD3 reduces a pair of real matrices (A,B) to generalized upper
 Hessenberg form using orthogonal transformations, where A is a
 general matrix and B is upper triangular.  The form of the
 generalized eigenvalue problem is
    A*x = lambda*B*x,
 and B is typically made upper triangular by computing its QR
 factorization and moving the orthogonal matrix Q to the left side
 of the equation.

 This subroutine simultaneously reduces A to a Hessenberg matrix H:
    Q**T*A*Z = H
 and transforms B to another upper triangular matrix T:
    Q**T*B*Z = T
 in order to reduce the problem to its standard form
    H*y = lambda*T*y
 where y = Z**T*x.

 The orthogonal matrices Q and Z are determined as products of Givens
 rotations.  They may either be formed explicitly, or they may be
 postmultiplied into input matrices Q1 and Z1, so that

      Q1 * A * Z1**T = (Q1*Q) * H * (Z1*Z)**T

      Q1 * B * Z1**T = (Q1*Q) * T * (Z1*Z)**T

 If Q1 is the orthogonal matrix from the QR factorization of B in the
 original equation A*x = lambda*B*x, then SGGHD3 reduces the original
 problem to generalized Hessenberg form.

 This is a blocked variant of SGGHRD, using matrix-matrix
 multiplications for parts of the computation to enhance performance.

  This routine reduces A to Hessenberg form and maintains B in
  using a blocked variant of Moler and Stewart's original algorithm,
  as described by Kagstrom, Kressner, Quintana-Orti, and Quintana-Orti
