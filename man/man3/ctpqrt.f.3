  The input matrix C is a (N+M)-by-N matrix

               C = [ A ]
                   [ B ]

  where A is an upper triangular N-by-N matrix, and B is M-by-N pentagonal
  matrix consisting of a (M-L)-by-N rectangular matrix B1 on top of a L-by-N
  upper trapezoidal matrix B2:

               B = [ B1 ]  <- (M-L)-by-N rectangular
                   [ B2 ]  <-     L-by-N upper trapezoidal.

  The upper trapezoidal matrix B2 consists of the first L rows of a
  N-by-N upper triangular matrix, where 0 <= L <= MIN(M,N).  If L=0,
  B is rectangular M-by-N; if M=L=N, B is upper triangular.

  The matrix W stores the elementary reflectors H(i) in the i-th column
  below the diagonal (of A) in the (N+M)-by-N input matrix C

               C = [ A ]  <- upper triangular N-by-N
                   [ B ]  <- M-by-N pentagonal

  so that W can be represented as

               W = [ I ]  <- identity, N-by-N
                   [ V ]  <- M-by-N, same form as B.

  Thus, all of information needed for W is contained on exit in B, which
  we call V above.  Note that V has the same form as B; that is,

               V = [ V1 ] <- (M-L)-by-N rectangular
                   [ V2 ] <-     L-by-N upper trapezoidal.

  The columns of V represent the vectors which define the H(i)'s.

  The number of blocks is B = ceiling(N/NB), where each
  block is of order NB except for the last block, which is of order
  IB = N - (B-1)*NB.  For each of the B blocks, a upper triangular block
  reflector factor is computed: T1, T2, ..., TB.  The NB-by-NB (and IB-by-IB
  for the last block) T's are stored in the NB-by-N matrix T as

               T = [T1 T2 ... TB].
