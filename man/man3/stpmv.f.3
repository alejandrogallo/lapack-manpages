\fBSTPMV\fP 
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 STPMV  performs one of the matrix-vector operations

    x := A*x,   or   x := A**T*x,

 where x is an n element vector and  A is an n by n unit, or non-unit,
 upper or lower triangular matrix, supplied in packed form.

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or
           lower triangular matrix as follows:

              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.

              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.

\fITRANS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          TRANS is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, TRANS specifies the operation to be performed as
           follows:

              TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   x := A*x.

              TRANS = 'T' or 't'   x := A**T*x.

              TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   x := A**T*x.

\fIDIAG\fP 
.PP
.nf
          DIAG is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit
           triangular as follows:

              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.

              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
                                  triangular.

\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
           N must be at least zero.

\fIAP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          AP is REAL array, dimension at least
           ( ( n*( n + 1 ) )/2 ).
           Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the array AP must
           contain the upper triangular matrix packed sequentially,
           column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ),
           AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 1, 2 ) and a( 2, 2 )
           respectively, and so on.
           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the array AP must
           contain the lower triangular matrix packed sequentially,
           column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ),
           AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 2, 1 ) and a( 3, 1 )
           respectively, and so on.
           Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of
           A are not referenced, but are assumed to be unity.

\fIX\fP 
.PP
.nf
          X is REAL array, dimension at least
           ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
           Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
           element vector x. On exit, X is overwritten with the
           transformed vector x.
.fi

\fIINCX\fP 
.PP
.nf
          INCX is INTEGER
           On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
           X. INCX must not be zero.
