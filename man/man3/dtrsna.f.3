.PP
.nf
 DTRSNA estimates reciprocal condition numbers for specified
 eigenvalues and/or right eigenvectors of a real upper
 quasi-triangular matrix T (or of any matrix Q*T*Q**T with Q
 orthogonal).

 T must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by DHSEQR), that is,
 block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks; each
 2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
 off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.

          is set to 0; this can only occur when the true value would be

  The reciprocal of the condition number of an eigenvalue lambda is
  defined as

          S(lambda) = |v**T*u| / (norm(u)*norm(v))

  where u and v are the right and left eigenvectors of T corresponding
  to lambda; v**T denotes the transpose of v, and norm(u)
  denotes the Euclidean norm. These reciprocal condition numbers always
  lie between zero (very badly conditioned) and one (very well
  conditioned). If n = 1, S(lambda) is defined to be 1.

  An approximate error bound for a computed eigenvalue W(i) is given by

                      EPS * norm(T) / S(i)

  where EPS is the machine precision.

  The reciprocal of the condition number of the right eigenvector u
  corresponding to lambda is defined as follows. Suppose

              T = ( lambda  c  )
                  (   0    T22 )

  Then the reciprocal condition number is

          SEP( lambda, T22 ) = sigma-min( T22 - lambda*I )

  where sigma-min denotes the smallest singular value. We approximate
  the smallest singular value by the reciprocal of an estimate of the
  one-norm of the inverse of T22 - lambda*I. If n = 1, SEP(1) is
  defined to be abs(T(1,1)).

  An approximate error bound for a computed right eigenvector VR(i)
  is given by

                      EPS * norm(T) / SEP(i)
