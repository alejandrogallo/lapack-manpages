.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SSYR2  performs the symmetric rank 2 operation

    A := alpha*x*y**T + alpha*y*x**T + A,

 where alpha is a scalar, x and y are n element vectors and A is an n
 by n symmetric matrix.

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
           triangular part of the array A is to be referenced as
           follows:

              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of A
                                  is to be referenced.

              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of A
                                  is to be referenced.

\fIN\fP

.nf
          N is INTEGER
           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
           N must be at least zero.

\fIALPHA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          ALPHA is REAL
           On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.

\fIX\fP 
.PP
.nf
          X is REAL array, dimension at least
           ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
           Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
           element vector x.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIINCX\fP 
.PP
.nf
          INCX is INTEGER
           On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
           X. INCX must not be zero.

\fIY\fP 
.PP
.nf
          Y is REAL array, dimension at least
           ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ).
           Before entry, the incremented array Y must contain the n
           element vector y.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIINCY\fP

.nf
          INCY is INTEGER
           On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of

\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is REAL array, dimension ( LDA, N )
           Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n
           upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper
           triangular part of the symmetric matrix and the strictly
           lower triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit, the
           upper triangular part of the array A is overwritten by the
           upper triangular part of the updated matrix.
           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n
           lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower
           triangular part of the symmetric matrix and the strictly
           upper triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit, the
           lower triangular part of the array A is overwritten by the
           lower triangular part of the updated matrix.

\fILDA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDA is INTEGER
           On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
           in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
           max( 1, n ).
