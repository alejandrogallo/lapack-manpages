.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 Level 3 BLAS like routine for A in RFP Format.

 STFSM  solves the matrix equation

    op( A )*X = alpha*B  or  X*op( A ) = alpha*B

 where alpha is a scalar, X and B are m by n matrices, A is a unit, or
 non-unit,  upper or lower triangular matrix  and  op( A )  is one  of

    op( A ) = A   or   op( A ) = A**T.

 A is in Rectangular Full Packed (RFP) Format.

 The matrix X is overwritten on B.

.nf
          A is REAL array, dimension (NT)
           NT = N*(N+1)/2. On entry, the matrix A in RFP Format.
           RFP Format is described by TRANSR, UPLO and N as follows:
           If TRANSR='N' then RFP A is (0:N,0:K-1) when N is even;
           K=N/2. RFP A is (0:N-1,0:K) when N is odd; K=N/2. If
           TRANSR = 'T' then RFP is the transpose of RFP A as
           defined when TRANSR = 'N'. The contents of RFP A are defined
           by UPLO as follows: If UPLO = 'U' the RFP A contains the NT
           elements of upper packed A either in normal or
           transpose Format. If UPLO = 'L' the RFP A contains
           the NT elements of lower packed A either in normal or
           transpose Format. The LDA of RFP A is (N+1)/2 when
           TRANSR = 'T'. When TRANSR is 'N' the LDA is N+1 when N is
           even and is N when is odd.

  We first consider Rectangular Full Packed (RFP) Format when N is
  even. We give an example where N = 6.

      AP is Upper             AP is Lower

   00 01 02 03 04 05       00
      11 12 13 14 15       10 11
         22 23 24 25       20 21 22
            33 34 35       30 31 32 33
               44 45       40 41 42 43 44
                  55       50 51 52 53 54 55


  Let TRANSR = 'N'. RFP holds AP as follows:
  For UPLO = 'U' the upper trapezoid A(0:5,0:2) consists of the last
  three columns of AP upper. The lower triangle A(4:6,0:2) consists of
  the transpose of the first three columns of AP upper.
  For UPLO = 'L' the lower trapezoid A(1:6,0:2) consists of the first
  three columns of AP lower. The upper triangle A(0:2,0:2) consists of
  the transpose of the last three columns of AP lower.
  This covers the case N even and TRANSR = 'N'.

         RFP A                   RFP A

        03 04 05                33 43 53
        13 14 15                00 44 54
        23 24 25                10 11 55
        33 34 35                20 21 22
        00 44 45                30 31 32
        01 11 55                40 41 42
        02 12 22                50 51 52

  Now let TRANSR = 'T'. RFP A in both UPLO cases is just the
  transpose of RFP A above. One therefore gets:


           RFP A                   RFP A

     03 13 23 33 00 01 02    33 00 10 20 30 40 50
     04 14 24 34 44 11 12    43 44 11 21 31 41 51
     05 15 25 35 45 55 22    53 54 55 22 32 42 52


  We then consider Rectangular Full Packed (RFP) Format when N is
  odd. We give an example where N = 5.

     AP is Upper                 AP is Lower

   00 01 02 03 04              00

         22 23 24              20 21 22
            33 34              30 31 32 33
               44              40 41 42 43 44


  Let TRANSR = 'N'. RFP holds AP as follows:
  For UPLO = 'U' the upper trapezoid A(0:4,0:2) consists of the last
  three columns of AP upper. The lower triangle A(3:4,0:1) consists of
  the transpose of the first two columns of AP upper.
  For UPLO = 'L' the lower trapezoid A(0:4,0:2) consists of the first
  three columns of AP lower. The upper triangle A(0:1,1:2) consists of
  the transpose of the last two columns of AP lower.
  This covers the case N odd and TRANSR = 'N'.

         RFP A                   RFP A

        02 03 04                00 33 43
        12 13 14                10 11 44
        22 23 24                20 21 22
        00 33 34                30 31 32
        01 11 44                40 41 42

  Now let TRANSR = 'T'. RFP A in both UPLO cases is just the
  transpose of RFP A above. One therefore gets:

           RFP A                   RFP A

     02 12 22 00 01             00 10 20 30 40 50
     03 13 23 33 11             33 11 21 31 41 51
