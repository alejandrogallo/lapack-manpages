\fBSLAED8\fP used by sstedc\&. Merges eigenvalues and deflates secular equation\&. Used when the original matrix is dense\&.  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SLAED8 merges the two sets of eigenvalues together into a single
 sorted set.  Then it tries to deflate the size of the problem.
 There are two ways in which deflation can occur:  when two or more
 eigenvalues are close together or if there is a tiny element in the
 Z vector.  For each such occurrence the order of the related secular
 equation problem is reduced by one.

                to reduce the original matrix to tridiagonal form.

         multiplies with other partially solved eigensystems.

         The permutation which separately sorts the two sub-problems
         in D into ascending order.  Note that elements in the second
