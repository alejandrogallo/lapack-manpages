.nf
 SGSVJ0 is called from SGESVJ as a pre-processor and that is its main
 purpose. It applies Jacobi rotations in the same way as SGESVJ does, but
 it does not check convergence (stopping criterion). Few tuning
 parameters (marked by [TP]) are available for the implementer.

          JOBV is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the output from this procedure is used
          to compute the matrix V:

                 by postmulyiplying the N-by-N array V.
                (See the description of V.)

                 by postmulyiplying the MV-by-N array V.
