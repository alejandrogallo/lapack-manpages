.nf
  THRESH is a threshold value used to decide if row or column scaling
  should be done based on the ratio of the row or column scaling
  factors.  If ROWCND < THRESH, row scaling is done, and if
  COLCND < THRESH, column scaling is done.

  LARGE and SMALL are threshold values used to decide if row scaling
  should be done based on the absolute size of the largest matrix
  element.  If AMAX > LARGE or AMAX < SMALL, row scaling is done.
