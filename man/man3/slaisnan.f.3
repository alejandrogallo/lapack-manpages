.nf
 This routine is not for general use.  It exists solely to avoid
 over-optimization in SISNAN.

 SLAISNAN checks for NaNs by comparing its two arguments for
 inequality.  NaN is the only floating-point value where NaN != NaN
 returns .TRUE.  To check for NaNs, pass the same variable as both
 arguments.

 A compiler must assume that the two arguments are
 not the same variable, and the test will not be optimized away.
 Interprocedural or whole-program optimization may delete this
 test.  The ISNAN functions will be replaced by the correct
 Fortran 03 intrinsic once the intrinsic is widely available.
