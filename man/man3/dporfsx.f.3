\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
    DPORFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
    equations when the coefficient matrix is symmetric positive
    definite, and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
    for the solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code
    provides maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See
    comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the
    error bounds.

    The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
    before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED and S
    below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned are
    for the original unequilibrated system.

.nf
     Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
     settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
     defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
     can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
     the PARAMS argument.

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1

.PP
.br
\fIEQUED\fP 
.PP
.nf
          EQUED is CHARACTER*1
     Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
     before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
     the solution and error bounds correctly.
       = 'N':  No equilibration
       = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
               replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
               The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.

\fINRHS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          NRHS is INTEGER

.fi
.PP
.br
\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
     The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
     upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part
     of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A
     is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
     triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
     the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is
     not referenced.

\fIAF\fP 
.PP
.nf
          AF is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAF,N)
     The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
     A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by DPOTRF.

.PP
.br
\fIS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
     The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
     the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
     'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
     = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
     element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
     of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
     and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
     rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
     Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
     is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
     that may not be reliable.

\fIRCOND\fP 
.PP
.nf
          RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
     Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
     reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
     equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
     if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
     conditioned.

.PP

\fIBERR\fP 
.PP
.nf
          BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
     Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
     componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
     (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
     makes X(j) an exact solution).

\fIN_ERR_BNDS\fP

          N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
     Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side

\fIERR_BNDS_NORM\fP 
.PP
.nf
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     cautions.

\fIERR_BNDS_COMP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

          PARAMS is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NPARAMS)

                    possibly with doubled-single computations if the

         only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
         componentwise error is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0) then
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
         bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
         that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (PARAMS(3) = 1.0)
         the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or
         componentwise error bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest
         J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or
         ERR_BNDS_COMP(J,1) = 0.0). See the definition of
