.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CSYCON_ROOK estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
 1-norm) of a complex symmetric matrix A using the factorization
 A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by CSYTRF_ROOK.

 An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
 condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
.fi

.br
\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
          The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to

.fi
.PP
.br
\fILDA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDA is INTEGER
