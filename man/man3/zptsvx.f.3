\fB ZPTSVX computes the solution to system of linear equations A * X = B for PT matrices\fP  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 ZPTSVX uses the factorization A = L*D*L**H to compute the solution
 to a complex system of linear equations A*X = B, where A is an
 N-by-N Hermitian positive definite tridiagonal matrix and X and B
 are N-by-NRHS matrices.

 Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
 provided.

\fBDescription: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 The following steps are performed:

 1. If FACT = 'N', the matrix A is factored as A = L*D*L**H, where L
    is a unit lower bidiagonal matrix and D is diagonal.  The
    factorization can also be regarded as having the form
    A = U**H*D*U.

 2. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
    then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
    form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
    A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
    precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
    still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
    described below.

 3. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
    of A.

 4. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
    matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
    for it.

          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
                <= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
                       not positive definite, so the factorization
                       could not be completed, and the solution has not
                       been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                       precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                       to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                       solution and error bounds are computed because
                       there are a number of situations where the
                       computed solution can be more accurate than the
                       value of RCOND would suggest.
