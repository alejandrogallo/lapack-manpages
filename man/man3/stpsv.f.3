\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 STPSV  solves one of the systems of equations

    A*x = b,   or   A**T*x = b,

 where b and x are n element vectors and A is an n by n unit, or
 non-unit, upper or lower triangular matrix, supplied in packed form.

 No test for singularity or near-singularity is included in this
 routine. Such tests must be performed before calling this routine.

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix is an upper or
           lower triangular matrix as follows:

              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   A is an upper triangular matrix.

              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   A is a lower triangular matrix.

\fITRANS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          TRANS is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, TRANS specifies the equations to be solved as
           follows:

              TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   A*x = b.

              TRANS = 'T' or 't'   A**T*x = b.

              TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   A**T*x = b.
.fi
.PP

\fIDIAG\fP 
.PP
.nf
          DIAG is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit
           triangular as follows:

              DIAG = 'U' or 'u'   A is assumed to be unit triangular.

              DIAG = 'N' or 'n'   A is not assumed to be unit
                                  triangular.

\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
           N must be at least zero.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIAP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          AP is REAL array, dimension at least
           ( ( n*( n + 1 ) )/2 ).
           Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the array AP must
           contain the upper triangular matrix packed sequentially,
           column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ),
           AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 1, 2 ) and a( 2, 2 )
           respectively, and so on.
           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the array AP must
           contain the lower triangular matrix packed sequentially,
           column by column, so that AP( 1 ) contains a( 1, 1 ),
           AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 2, 1 ) and a( 3, 1 )
           respectively, and so on.
           Note that when  DIAG = 'U' or 'u', the diagonal elements of
           A are not referenced, but are assumed to be unity.

\fIX\fP 
.PP
.nf
          X is REAL array, dimension at least
           ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
           Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
           element right-hand side vector b. On exit, X is overwritten
           with the solution vector x.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIINCX\fP 
.PP
.nf
          INCX is INTEGER
           On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
           X. INCX must not be zero.
