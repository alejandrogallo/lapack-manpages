\fB CHEEVD computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors for HE matrices\fP  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CHEEVD computes all eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors of a
 complex Hermitian matrix A.  If eigenvectors are desired, it uses a
 divide and conquer algorithm.

 The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
 floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
 digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
 digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
 Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
 without guard digits, but we know of none.

          JOBZ is CHARACTER*1

          UPLO is CHARACTER*1

.nf
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

.PP
.br
\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA, N)
          On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the
          leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
          upper triangular part of the matrix A.  If UPLO = 'L',
          the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains
          the lower triangular part of the matrix A.
          On exit, if JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, A contains the
          orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A.
          If JOBZ = 'N', then on exit the lower triangle (if UPLO='L')
          or the upper triangle (if UPLO='U') of A, including the
          diagonal, is destroyed.

\fIWORK\fP 
.PP
.nf
          WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))

\fILWORK\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LWORK is INTEGER
          The length of the array WORK.
          If N <= 1,                LWORK must be at least 1.
          If JOBZ  = 'N' and N > 1, LWORK must be at least N + 1.
          If JOBZ  = 'V' and N > 1, LWORK must be at least 2*N + N**2.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK and
          IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries of
          the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message
          related to LWORK or LRWORK or LIWORK is issued by XERBLA.

                         1 + 5*N + 2*N**2.

          If LRWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
          routine only calculates the optimal sizes of the WORK, RWORK
          and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
          of the WORK, RWORK and IWORK arrays, and no error message

          If JOBZ  = 'V' and N > 1, LIWORK must be at least 3 + 5*N.

          and IWORK arrays, returns these values as the first entries
