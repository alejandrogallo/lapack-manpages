.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SSYGVX computes selected eigenvalues, and optionally, eigenvectors
 of a real generalized symmetric-definite eigenproblem, of the form
 A*x=(lambda)*B*x,  A*Bx=(lambda)*x,  or B*A*x=(lambda)*x.  Here A
 and B are assumed to be symmetric and B is also positive definite.
 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be selected by specifying either a
 range of values or a range of indices for the desired eigenvalues.

\fIABSTOL\fP 
.PP
.nf
          ABSTOL is REAL
          The absolute error tolerance for the eigenvalues.
          An approximate eigenvalue is accepted as converged
          when it is determined to lie in an interval [a,b]
          of width less than or equal to

                  ABSTOL + EPS *   max( |a|,|b| ) ,

          where EPS is the machine precision.  If ABSTOL is less than
          or equal to zero, then  EPS*|T|  will be used in its place,
          where |T| is the 1-norm of the tridiagonal matrix obtained
          by reducing C to tridiagonal form, where C is the symmetric
          matrix of the standard symmetric problem to which the
          generalized problem is transformed.

          Eigenvalues will be computed most accurately when ABSTOL is
          set to twice the underflow threshold 2*DLAMCH('S'), not zero.
          If this routine returns with INFO>0, indicating that some
          eigenvectors did not converge, try setting ABSTOL to
          2*SLAMCH('S').

\fIM\fP 
.PP
.nf
          M is INTEGER
          The total number of eigenvalues found.  0 <= M <= N.

\fIW\fP 
.PP
.nf

\fIZ\fP 
.PP
.nf
          Z is REAL array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M))
          If JOBZ = 'N', then Z is not referenced.
          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M columns of Z
          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix A
          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
          The eigenvectors are normalized as follows:
          if ITYPE = 1 or 2, Z**T*B*Z = I;
          if ITYPE = 3, Z**T*inv(B)*Z = I.

          If an eigenvector fails to converge, then that column of Z
          contains the latest approximation to the eigenvector, and the
          index of the eigenvector is returned in IFAIL.
          Note: the user must ensure that at least max(1,M) columns are
          supplied in the array Z; if RANGE = 'V', the exact value of M
          is not known in advance and an upper bound must be used.

\fILDZ\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDZ is INTEGER
          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if

\fIWORK\fP 
.PP
.nf
          WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fILWORK\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LWORK is INTEGER
          The length of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,8*N).
          For optimal efficiency, LWORK >= (NB+3)*N,
          where NB is the blocksize for SSYTRD returned by ILAENV.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

.nf
          IFAIL is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          If JOBZ = 'V', then if INFO = 0, the first M elements of
          IFAIL are zero.  If INFO > 0, then IFAIL contains the
          indices of the eigenvectors that failed to converge.
          If JOBZ = 'N', then IFAIL is not referenced.

          > 0:  SPOTRF or SSYEVX returned an error code:
             <= N:  if INFO = i, SSYEVX failed to converge;
                    i eigenvectors failed to converge.  Their indices
                    are stored in array IFAIL.
             > N:   if INFO = N + i, for 1 <= i <= N, then the leading
                    minor of order i of B is not positive definite.
                    The factorization of B could not be completed and
                    no eigenvalues or eigenvectors were computed.
