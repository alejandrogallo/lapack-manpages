          set by a previous call to ZGEBAL; otherwise they should be
          set to 1 and N respectively. See Further Details.

  The matrix Q is represented as a product of (ihi-ilo) elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(ilo) H(ilo+1) . . . H(ihi-1).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H

  where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
  v(1:i) = 0, v(i+1) = 1 and v(ihi+1:n) = 0; v(i+2:ihi) is stored on
  exit in A(i+2:ihi,i), and tau in TAU(i).

  The contents of A are illustrated by the following example, with
  n = 7, ilo = 2 and ihi = 6:

  on entry,                        on exit,

  ( a   a   a   a   a   a   a )    (  a   a   h   h   h   h   a )
  (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      a   h   h   h   h   a )
  (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      h   h   h   h   h   h )
  (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      v2  h   h   h   h   h )
  (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      v2  v3  h   h   h   h )
  (     a   a   a   a   a   a )    (      v2  v3  v4  h   h   h )
  (                         a )    (                          a )

  where a denotes an element of the original matrix A, h denotes a
  modified element of the upper Hessenberg matrix H, and vi denotes an
  element of the vector defining H(i).
