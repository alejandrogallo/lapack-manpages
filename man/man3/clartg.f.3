\fBCLARTG\fP generates a plane rotation with real cosine and complex sine\&.  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CLARTG generates a plane rotation so that

    [  CS  SN  ]     [ F ]     [ R ]
    [  __      ]  .  [   ]  =  [   ]   where CS**2 + |SN|**2 = 1.
    [ -SN  CS  ]     [ G ]     [ 0 ]

 This is a faster version of the BLAS1 routine CROTG, except for
 the following differences:
    F and G are unchanged on return.
    If G=0, then CS=1 and SN=0.
    If F=0, then CS=0 and SN is chosen so that R is real.
