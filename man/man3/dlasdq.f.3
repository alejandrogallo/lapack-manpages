\fBDLASDQ\fP computes the SVD of a real bidiagonal matrix with diagonal d and off-diagonal e\&. Used by sbdsdc\&.  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 DLASDQ computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
 (upper or lower) bidiagonal matrix with diagonal D and offdiagonal
 E, accumulating the transformations if desired. Letting B denote
 the input bidiagonal matrix, the algorithm computes orthogonal
 matrices Q and P such that B = Q * S * P**T (P**T denotes the transpose
 of P). The singular values S are overwritten on D.

 The input matrix U  is changed to U  * Q  if desired.
 The input matrix VT is changed to P**T * VT if desired.
 The input matrix C  is changed to Q**T * C  if desired.

 See "Computing  Small Singular Values of Bidiagonal Matrices With
 Guaranteed High Relative Accuracy," by J. Demmel and W. Kahan,
 LAPACK Working Note #3, for a detailed description of the algorithm.

\fIUPLO\fP

.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
        On entry, UPLO specifies whether the input bidiagonal matrix
        is upper or lower bidiagonal, and whether it is square are
        not.

           UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   B is lower bidiagonal.

.nf
          SQRE is INTEGER
        = 0: then the input matrix is N-by-N.
        = 1: then the input matrix is N-by-(N+1) if UPLU = 'U' and
             (N+1)-by-N if UPLU = 'L'.

        The bidiagonal matrix has
        N = NL + NR + 1 rows and
        M = N + SQRE >= N columns.
