 CPTCON computes the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
 1-norm) of a complex Hermitian positive definite tridiagonal matrix
 using the factorization A = L*D*L**H or A = U**H*D*U computed by
 CPTTRF.

 Norm(inv(A)) is computed by a direct method, and the reciprocal of
 the condition number is computed as
                  RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).
