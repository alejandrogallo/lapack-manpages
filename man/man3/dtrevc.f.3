 DTREVC computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
 a real upper quasi-triangular matrix T.
 Matrices of this type are produced by the Schur factorization of
 a real general matrix:  A = Q*T*Q**T, as computed by DHSEQR.

 The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of T corresponding
 to an eigenvalue w are defined by:

    T*x = w*x,     (y**H)*T = w*(y**H)

 where y**H denotes the conjugate transpose of y.
 The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are read directly
 from the diagonal blocks of T.

 This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
 eigenvectors of T, or the products Q*X and/or Q*Y, where Q is an
 input matrix.  If Q is the orthogonal factor that reduces a matrix
 A to Schur form T, then Q*X and Q*Y are the matrices of right and
 left eigenvectors of A.

  The algorithm used in this program is basically backward (forward)
  substitution, with scaling to make the the code robust against
  possible overflow.

  Each eigenvector is normalized so that the element of largest
  magnitude has magnitude 1; here the magnitude of a complex number
  (x,y) is taken to be |x| + |y|.
