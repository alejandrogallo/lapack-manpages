\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CHBGVD computes all the eigenvalues, and optionally, the eigenvectors
 of a complex generalized Hermitian-definite banded eigenproblem, of
 the form A*x=(lambda)*B*x. Here A and B are assumed to be Hermitian
 and banded, and B is also positive definite.  If eigenvectors are
 desired, it uses a divide and conquer algorithm.

 The divide and conquer algorithm makes very mild assumptions about
 floating point arithmetic. It will work on machines with a guard
 digit in add/subtract, or on those binary machines without guard
 digits which subtract like the Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, Cray C-90, or
 Cray-2. It could conceivably fail on hexadecimal or decimal machines
 without guard digits, but we know of none.
