\fBCHBMV\fP 
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CHBMV  performs the matrix-vector  operation

    y := alpha*A*x + beta*y,

 where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are n element vectors and
 A is an n by n hermitian band matrix, with k super-diagonals.

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
           On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
           triangular part of the band matrix A is being supplied as
           follows:

              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   The upper triangular part of A is
                                  being supplied.

              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   The lower triangular part of A is
                                  being supplied.

\fIN\fP

.nf
          N is INTEGER
           On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.
           N must be at least zero.
.fi

.br
\fIK\fP 
.PP
.nf
          K is INTEGER
           On entry, K specifies the number of super-diagonals of the
           matrix A. K must satisfy  0 .le. K.
.fi

\fIALPHA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          ALPHA is COMPLEX
           On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.

.PP

\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is COMPLEX array, dimension ( LDA, N )
           Before entry with UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading ( k + 1 )
           by n part of the array A must contain the upper triangular
           band part of the hermitian matrix, supplied column by
           column, with the leading diagonal of the matrix in row
           ( k + 1 ) of the array, the first super-diagonal starting at
           position 2 in row k, and so on. The top left k by k triangle
           of the array A is not referenced.
           The following program segment will transfer the upper
           triangular part of a hermitian band matrix from conventional
           full matrix storage to band storage:

                 DO 20, J = 1, N
                    M = K + 1 - J
                    DO 10, I = MAX( 1, J - K ), J
                       A( M + I, J ) = matrix( I, J )
              10    CONTINUE
              20 CONTINUE

           Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading ( k + 1 )
           by n part of the array A must contain the lower triangular
           band part of the hermitian matrix, supplied column by
           column, with the leading diagonal of the matrix in row 1 of
           the array, the first sub-diagonal starting at position 1 in
           row 2, and so on. The bottom right k by k triangle of the
           array A is not referenced.
           The following program segment will transfer the lower
           triangular part of a hermitian band matrix from conventional
           full matrix storage to band storage:

                 DO 20, J = 1, N
                    M = 1 - J
                    DO 10, I = J, MIN( N, J + K )
                       A( M + I, J ) = matrix( I, J )
              10    CONTINUE
              20 CONTINUE

           Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need
           not be set and are assumed to be zero.
