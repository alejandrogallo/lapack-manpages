.PP
.nf
 ZSYTRS_3 solves a system of linear equations A * X = B with a complex
 symmetric matrix A using the factorization computed
 by ZSYTRF_RK or ZSYTRF_BK:

    A = P*U*D*(U**T)*(P**T) or A = P*L*D*(L**T)*(P**T),

 where U (or L) is unit upper (or lower) triangular matrix,
 U**T (or L**T) is the transpose of U (or L), P is a permutation
 matrix, P**T is the transpose of P, and D is symmetric and block
 diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

 This algorithm is using Level 3 BLAS.

          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = P*L*D*(L**T)*(P**T).
