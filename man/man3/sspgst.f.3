.nf
 SSPGST reduces a real symmetric-definite generalized eigenproblem
 to standard form, using packed storage.

 If ITYPE = 1, the problem is A*x = lambda*B*x,
 and A is overwritten by inv(U**T)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**T)

 If ITYPE = 2 or 3, the problem is A*B*x = lambda*x or
 B*A*x = lambda*x, and A is overwritten by U*A*U**T or L**T*A*L.

 B must have been previously factorized as U**T*U or L*L**T by SPPTRF.

          ITYPE is INTEGER

          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
                  U**T*U;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
                  L*L**T.

.nf
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.

\fIAP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          AP is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
          is stored in the array AP as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the transformed matrix, stored in the
          same format as A.

          BP is REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          The triangular factor from the Cholesky factorization of B,
          stored in the same format as A, as returned by SPPTRF.
