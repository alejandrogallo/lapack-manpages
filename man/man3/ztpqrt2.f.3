  The input matrix C is a (N+M)-by-N matrix

               C = [ A ]
                   [ B ]

  where A is an upper triangular N-by-N matrix, and B is M-by-N pentagonal
  matrix consisting of a (M-L)-by-N rectangular matrix B1 on top of a L-by-N
  upper trapezoidal matrix B2:

               B = [ B1 ]  <- (M-L)-by-N rectangular
                   [ B2 ]  <-     L-by-N upper trapezoidal.

  The upper trapezoidal matrix B2 consists of the first L rows of a
  N-by-N upper triangular matrix, where 0 <= L <= MIN(M,N).  If L=0,
  B is rectangular M-by-N; if M=L=N, B is upper triangular.

  The matrix W stores the elementary reflectors H(i) in the i-th column
  below the diagonal (of A) in the (N+M)-by-N input matrix C

               C = [ A ]  <- upper triangular N-by-N
                   [ B ]  <- M-by-N pentagonal

  so that W can be represented as

               W = [ I ]  <- identity, N-by-N
                   [ V ]  <- M-by-N, same form as B.

  Thus, all of information needed for W is contained on exit in B, which
  we call V above.  Note that V has the same form as B; that is,

               V = [ V1 ] <- (M-L)-by-N rectangular
                   [ V2 ] <-     L-by-N upper trapezoidal.

  The columns of V represent the vectors which define the H(i)'s.
  The (M+N)-by-(M+N) block reflector H is then given by

               H = I - W * T * W**H

  where W**H is the conjugate transpose of W and T is the upper triangular
  factor of the block reflector.
