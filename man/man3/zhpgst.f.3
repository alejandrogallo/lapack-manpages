.PP
.nf
 ZHPGST reduces a complex Hermitian-definite generalized
 eigenproblem to standard form, using packed storage.

 If ITYPE = 1, the problem is A*x = lambda*B*x,
 and A is overwritten by inv(U**H)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**H)

 If ITYPE = 2 or 3, the problem is A*B*x = lambda*x or
 B*A*x = lambda*x, and A is overwritten by U*A*U**H or L**H*A*L.

 B must have been previously factorized as U**H*U or L*L**H by ZPPTRF.

\fIITYPE\fP

.nf
          ITYPE is INTEGER
          = 1: compute inv(U**H)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**H);
          = 2 or 3: compute U*A*U**H or L**H*A*L.

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
                  U**H*U;
          = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
                  L*L**H.

\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.

.br
\fIAP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          AP is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix
          A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
          is stored in the array AP as follows:
          if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
          if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

          On exit, if INFO = 0, the transformed matrix, stored in the
          same format as A.

.nf
          BP is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
          The triangular factor from the Cholesky factorization of B,
          stored in the same format as A, as returned by ZPPTRF.
