.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CLARGV generates a vector of complex plane rotations with real
 cosines, determined by elements of the complex vectors x and y.
 For i = 1,2,...,n

    (        c(i)   s(i) ) ( x(i) ) = ( r(i) )
    ( -conjg(s(i))  c(i) ) ( y(i) ) = (   0  )

    where c(i)**2 + ABS(s(i))**2 = 1

 The following conventions are used (these are the same as in CLARTG,
 but differ from the BLAS1 routine CROTG):
    If y(i)=0, then c(i)=1 and s(i)=0.
    If x(i)=0, then c(i)=0 and s(i) is chosen so that r(i) is real.
