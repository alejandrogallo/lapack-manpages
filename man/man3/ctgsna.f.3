  The reciprocal of the condition number of the i-th generalized
  eigenvalue w = (a, b) is defined as

          S(I) = (|v**HAu|**2 + |v**HBu|**2)**(1/2) / (norm(u)*norm(v))

  where u and v are the right and left eigenvectors of (A, B)
  corresponding to w; |z| denotes the absolute value of the complex
  number, and norm(u) denotes the 2-norm of the vector u. The pair
  (a, b) corresponds to an eigenvalue w = a/b (= v**HAu/v**HBu) of the
  matrix pair (A, B). If both a and b equal zero, then (A,B) is
  singular and S(I) = -1 is returned.

  An approximate error bound on the chordal distance between the i-th
  computed generalized eigenvalue w and the corresponding exact
  eigenvalue lambda is

          chord(w, lambda) <=   EPS * norm(A, B) / S(I),

  where EPS is the machine precision.

  The reciprocal of the condition number of the right eigenvector u
  and left eigenvector v corresponding to the generalized eigenvalue w
  is defined as follows. Suppose

                   (A, B) = ( a   *  ) ( b  *  )  1
                            ( 0  A22 ),( 0 B22 )  n-1
                              1  n-1     1 n-1

  Then the reciprocal condition number DIF(I) is

          Difl[(a, b), (A22, B22)]  = sigma-min( Zl )

  where sigma-min(Zl) denotes the smallest singular value of

         Zl = [ kron(a, In-1) -kron(1, A22) ]
              [ kron(b, In-1) -kron(1, B22) ].

  Here In-1 is the identity matrix of size n-1 and X**H is the conjugate
  transpose of X. kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the
  matrices X and Y.

  We approximate the smallest singular value of Zl with an upper
  bound. This is done by CLATDF.

  An approximate error bound for a computed eigenvector VL(i) or
  VR(i) is given by

                      EPS * norm(A, B) / DIF(i).
