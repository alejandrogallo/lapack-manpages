 DLAQTR solves the real quasi-triangular system

              op(T)*p = scale*c,               if LREAL = .TRUE.

 or the complex quasi-triangular systems

            op(T + iB)*(p+iq) = scale*(c+id),  if LREAL = .FALSE.

 in real arithmetic, where T is upper quasi-triangular.
 If LREAL = .FALSE., then the first diagonal block of T must be
 1 by 1, B is the specially structured matrix

                B = [ b(1) b(2) ... b(n) ]
                    [       w            ]
                    [           w        ]
                    [              .     ]
                    [                 w  ]

 op(A) = A or A**T, A**T denotes the transpose of
 matrix A.

 On input, X = [ c ].  On output, X = [ p ].
               [ d ]                  [ q ]

 This subroutine is designed for the condition number estimation
 in routine DTRSNA.

               1: the some diagonal 1 by 1 block has been perturbed by
                  a small number SMIN to keep nonsingularity.
