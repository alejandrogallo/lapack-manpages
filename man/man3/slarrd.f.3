\fBSLARRD\fP computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix to suitable accuracy\&.  
.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 SLARRD computes the eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal
 matrix T to suitable accuracy. This is an auxiliary code to be
 called from SSTEMR.
 The user may ask for all eigenvalues, all eigenvalues
 in the half-open interval (VL, VU], or the IL-th through IU-th
 eigenvalues.

 To avoid overflow, the matrix must be scaled so that its
 largest element is no greater than overflow**(1/2) * underflow**(1/4) in absolute value, and for greatest
 accuracy, it should not be much smaller than that.

 See W. Kahan "Accurate Eigenvalues of a Symmetric Tridiagonal
 Matrix", Report CS41, Computer Science Dept., Stanford
 University, July 21, 1966.

          The minimum relative width of an interval.  When an interval
          is narrower than RELTOL times the larger (in
          magnitude) endpoint, then it is considered to be
          sufficiently small, i.e., converged.  Note: this should
          always be at least radix*machine epsilon.

          ISPLIT is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          The splitting points, at which T breaks up into submatrices.
          The first submatrix consists of rows/columns 1 to ISPLIT(1),
          the second of rows/columns ISPLIT(1)+1 through ISPLIT(2),
          etc., and the NSPLIT-th consists of rows/columns
          ISPLIT(NSPLIT-1)+1 through ISPLIT(NSPLIT)=N.
          (Only the first NSPLIT elements will actually be used, but
          since the user cannot know a priori what value NSPLIT will

.nf
          W is REAL array, dimension (N)
          On exit, the first M elements of W will contain the
          eigenvalue approximations. SLARRD computes an interval
          I_j = (a_j, b_j] that includes eigenvalue j. The eigenvalue
          approximation is given as the interval midpoint
          W(j)= ( a_j + b_j)/2. The corresponding error is bounded by
          WERR(j) = abs( a_j - b_j)/2

          WU is REAL
          The interval (WL, WU] contains all the wanted eigenvalues.
          If RANGE='V', then WL=VL and WU=VU.
          If RANGE='A', then WL and WU are the global Gerschgorin bounds
                        on the spectrum.
          If RANGE='I', then WL and WU are computed by SLAEBZ from the

\fIIBLOCK\fP 
.PP
.nf
          IBLOCK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          At each row/column j where E(j) is zero or small, the
          matrix T is considered to split into a block diagonal
          matrix.  On exit, if INFO = 0, IBLOCK(i) specifies to which
          block (from 1 to the number of blocks) the eigenvalue W(i)
          belongs.  (SLARRD may use the remaining N-M elements as
          workspace.)

\fIINDEXW\fP 
.PP
.nf
          INDEXW is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
          The indices of the eigenvalues within each block (submatrix);
          for example, INDEXW(i)= j and IBLOCK(i)=k imply that the
          i-th eigenvalue W(i) is the j-th eigenvalue in block k.

.nf
          INFO is INTEGER
          = 0:  successful exit
          < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
          > 0:  some or all of the eigenvalues failed to converge or
                were not computed:
                =1 or 3: Bisection failed to converge for some
                        eigenvalues; these eigenvalues are flagged by a
                        negative block number.  The effect is that the
                        eigenvalues may not be as accurate as the
                        absolute and relative tolerances.  This is
                        generally caused by unexpectedly inaccurate
                        arithmetic.
                =2 or 3: RANGE='I' only: Not all of the eigenvalues
                        IL:IU were found.
                        Effect: M < IU+1-IL
                        Cause:  non-monotonic arithmetic, causing the
                                Sturm sequence to be non-monotonic.
                        Cure:   recalculate, using RANGE='A', and pick
                                out eigenvalues IL:IU.  In some cases,
                                increasing the PARAMETER "FUDGE" may
                                make things work.
                = 4:    RANGE='I', and the Gershgorin interval
                        initially used was too small.  No eigenvalues
                        were computed.
                        Probable cause: your machine has sloppy
                                        floating-point arithmetic.
                        Cure: Increase the PARAMETER "FUDGE",
                              recompile, and try again.

  FUDGE   REAL, default = 2
          A "fudge factor" to widen the Gershgorin intervals.  Ideally,
          a value of 1 should work, but on machines with sloppy
          arithmetic, this needs to be larger.  The default for
          publicly released versions should be large enough to handle
          the worst machine around.  Note that this has no effect
          on accuracy of the solution.
