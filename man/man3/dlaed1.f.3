 DLAED1 computes the updated eigensystem of a diagonal
 matrix after modification by a rank-one symmetric matrix.  This
 routine is used only for the eigenproblem which requires all
 eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix.  DLAED7 handles
 the case in which eigenvalues only or eigenvalues and eigenvectors
 of a full symmetric matrix (which was reduced to tridiagonal form)
 are desired.

   T = Q(in) ( D(in) + RHO * Z*Z**T ) Q**T(in) = Q(out) * D(out) * Q**T(out)

    where Z = Q**T*u, u is a vector of length N with ones in the
    CUTPNT and CUTPNT + 1 th elements and zeros elsewhere.

    The eigenvectors of the original matrix are stored in Q, and the
    eigenvalues are in D.  The algorithm consists of three stages:

       The first stage consists of deflating the size of the problem
       when there are multiple eigenvalues or if there is a zero in
       the Z vector.  For each such occurrence the dimension of the
       secular equation problem is reduced by one.  This stage is
       performed by the routine DLAED2.

       The second stage consists of calculating the updated
       eigenvalues. This is done by finding the roots of the secular
       equation via the routine DLAED4 (as called by DLAED3).
       This routine also calculates the eigenvectors of the current
       problem.

       The final stage consists of computing the updated eigenvectors
       directly using the updated eigenvalues.  The eigenvectors for
       the current problem are multiplied with the eigenvectors from
       the overall problem.
