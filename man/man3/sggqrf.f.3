 SGGQRF computes a generalized QR factorization of an N-by-M matrix A
 and an N-by-P matrix B:

             A = Q*R,        B = Q*T*Z,

 where Q is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix, Z is a P-by-P orthogonal
 matrix, and R and T assume one of the forms:

 if N >= M,  R = ( R11 ) M  ,   or if N < M,  R = ( R11  R12 ) N,
                 (  0  ) N-M                         N   M-N
                    M

 where R11 is upper triangular, and

 if N <= P,  T = ( 0  T12 ) N,   or if N > P,  T = ( T11 ) N-P,
                  P-N  N                           ( T21 ) P
                                                      P

 where T12 or T21 is upper triangular.

 In particular, if B is square and nonsingular, the GQR factorization
 of A and B implicitly gives the QR factorization of inv(B)*A:

              inv(B)*A = Z**T*(inv(T)*R)

 where inv(B) denotes the inverse of the matrix B, and Z**T denotes the
 transpose of the matrix Z.

          RQ factorization of an N-by-P matrix, and NB3 is the optimal
          blocksize for a call of SORMQR.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
          message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

  The matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k), where k = min(n,m).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - taua * v * v**T

  where taua is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(1:i-1) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(i+1:n) is stored on exit in A(i+1:n,i),
  and taua in TAUA(i).
  To form Q explicitly, use LAPACK subroutine SORGQR.
  To use Q to update another matrix, use LAPACK subroutine SORMQR.

  The matrix Z is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

     Z = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k), where k = min(n,p).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - taub * v * v**T

  where taub is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(p-k+i+1:p) = 0 and v(p-k+i) = 1; v(1:p-k+i-1) is stored on exit in
  B(n-k+i,1:p-k+i-1), and taub in TAUB(i).
  To form Z explicitly, use LAPACK subroutine SORGRQ.
  To use Z to update another matrix, use LAPACK subroutine SORMRQ.
