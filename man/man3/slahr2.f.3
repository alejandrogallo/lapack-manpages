.PP
.nf
 SLAHR2 reduces the first NB columns of A real general n-BY-(n-k+1)
 matrix A so that elements below the k-th subdiagonal are zero. The
 reduction is performed by an orthogonal similarity transformation
 Q**T * A * Q. The routine returns the matrices V and T which determine
 Q as a block reflector I - V*T*V**T, and also the matrix Y = A * V * T.

 This is an auxiliary routine called by SGEHRD.

  The matrix Q is represented as a product of nb elementary reflectors

     Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(nb).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v**T

  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(1:i+k-1) = 0, v(i+k) = 1; v(i+k+1:n) is stored on exit in
  A(i+k+1:n,i), and tau in TAU(i).

  The elements of the vectors v together form the (n-k+1)-by-nb matrix
  V which is needed, with T and Y, to apply the transformation to the
  unreduced part of the matrix, using an update of the form:
  A := (I - V*T*V**T) * (A - Y*V**T).

  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following example
  with n = 7, k = 3 and nb = 2:

     ( a   a   a   a   a )
     ( a   a   a   a   a )
     ( a   a   a   a   a )
     ( h   h   a   a   a )
     ( v1  h   a   a   a )
     ( v1  v2  a   a   a )
     ( v1  v2  a   a   a )

  where a denotes an element of the original matrix A, h denotes a
  modified element of the upper Hessenberg matrix H, and vi denotes an
  element of the vector defining H(i).

  This subroutine is a slight modification of LAPACK-3.0's DLAHRD
  incorporating improvements proposed by Quintana-Orti and Van de
  Gejin. Note that the entries of A(1:K,2:NB) differ from those
  returned by the original LAPACK-3.0's DLAHRD routine. (This
  subroutine is not backward compatible with LAPACK-3.0's DLAHRD.)
