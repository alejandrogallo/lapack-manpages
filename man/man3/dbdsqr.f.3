 DBDSQR computes the singular values and, optionally, the right and/or
 left singular vectors from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of
 a real N-by-N (upper or lower) bidiagonal matrix B using the implicit
 zero-shift QR algorithm.  The SVD of B has the form

    B = Q * S * P**T

 where S is the diagonal matrix of singular values, Q is an orthogonal
 matrix of left singular vectors, and P is an orthogonal matrix of
 right singular vectors.  If left singular vectors are requested, this
 subroutine actually returns U*Q instead of Q, and, if right singular
 vectors are requested, this subroutine returns P**T*VT instead of
 P**T, for given real input matrices U and VT.  When U and VT are the
 orthogonal matrices that reduce a general matrix A to bidiagonal
 form:  A = U*B*VT, as computed by DGEBRD, then

    A = (U*Q) * S * (P**T*VT)

 is the SVD of A.  Optionally, the subroutine may also compute Q**T*C
 for a given real input matrix C.

  TOLMUL  DOUBLE PRECISION, default = max(10,min(100,EPS**(-1/8)))
          TOLMUL controls the convergence criterion of the QR loop.
          If it is positive, TOLMUL*EPS is the desired relative
             precision in the computed singular values.
          If it is negative, abs(TOLMUL*EPS*sigma_max) is the
             desired absolute accuracy in the computed singular
             values (corresponds to relative accuracy
             abs(TOLMUL*EPS) in the largest singular value.
          abs(TOLMUL) should be between 1 and 1/EPS, and preferably
             between 10 (for fast convergence) and .1/EPS
             (for there to be some accuracy in the results).
          Default is to lose at either one eighth or 2 of the
             available decimal digits in each computed singular value
             (whichever is smaller).

  MAXITR  INTEGER, default = 6
          MAXITR controls the maximum number of passes of the
          algorithm through its inner loop. The algorithms stops
          (and so fails to converge) if the number of passes
          through the inner loop exceeds MAXITR*N**2.

  Bug report from Cezary Dendek.
  On March 23rd 2017, the INTEGER variable MAXIT = MAXITR*N**2 is
  removed since it can overflow pretty easily (for N larger or equal
  than 18,919). We instead use MAXITDIVN = MAXITR*N.
