.PP
\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 DSYMM  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations

    C := alpha*A*B + beta*C,

 or

    C := alpha*B*A + beta*C,

 where alpha and beta are scalars,  A is a symmetric matrix and  B and
 C are  m by n matrices.

.nf
          SIDE is CHARACTER*1
           On entry,  SIDE  specifies whether  the  symmetric matrix  A
           appears on the  left or right  in the  operation as follows:

              SIDE = 'L' or 'l'   C := alpha*A*B + beta*C,

              SIDE = 'R' or 'r'   C := alpha*B*A + beta*C,

.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
           On  entry,   UPLO  specifies  whether  the  upper  or  lower
           triangular  part  of  the  symmetric  matrix   A  is  to  be
           referenced as follows:

              UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of the
                                  symmetric matrix is to be referenced.

              UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of the
                                  symmetric matrix is to be referenced.

          A is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( LDA, ka ), where ka is
           m  when  SIDE = 'L' or 'l'  and is  n otherwise.
           Before entry  with  SIDE = 'L' or 'l',  the  m by m  part of

           part of the array  A  must contain the upper triangular part
           of the  symmetric matrix and the  strictly  lower triangular
           part of  A  is not referenced,  and when  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',

          BETA is DOUBLE PRECISION.
           On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.  When  BETA  is

          C is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( LDC, N )
           Before entry, the leading  m by n  part of the array  C must
           contain the matrix  C,  except when  beta  is zero, in which
           case C need not be set on entry.
