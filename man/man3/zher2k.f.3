\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 ZHER2K  performs one of the hermitian rank 2k operations

    C := alpha*A*B**H + conjg( alpha )*B*A**H + beta*C,

 or

    C := alpha*A**H*B + conjg( alpha )*B**H*A + beta*C,

 where  alpha and beta  are scalars with  beta  real,  C is an  n by n
 hermitian matrix and  A and B  are  n by k matrices in the first case
 and  k by n  matrices in the second case.

          C is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension ( LDC, N )
           Before entry  with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u',  the leading  n by n
           upper triangular part of the array C must contain the upper
           triangular part  of the  hermitian matrix  and the strictly
           lower triangular part of C is not referenced.  On exit, the
           upper triangular part of the array  C is overwritten by the
           upper triangular part of the updated matrix.
           Before entry  with  UPLO = 'L' or 'l',  the leading  n by n
           lower triangular part of the array C must contain the lower
           triangular part  of the  hermitian matrix  and the strictly

           lower triangular part of the array  C is overwritten by the
           lower triangular part of the updated matrix.
           Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need
           not be set,  they are assumed to be zero,  and on exit they
           are set to zero.
