\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 DSYR2K  performs one of the symmetric rank 2k operations

    C := alpha*A*B**T + alpha*B*A**T + beta*C,

 or

    C := alpha*A**T*B + alpha*B**T*A + beta*C,

 where  alpha and beta  are scalars, C is an  n by n  symmetric matrix
 and  A and B  are  n by k  matrices  in the  first  case  and  k by n
 matrices in the second case.
