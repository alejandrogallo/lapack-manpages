 CLA_PORFSX_EXTENDED improves the computed solution to a system of
 linear equations by performing extra-precise iterative refinement
 and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
 This subroutine is called by CPORFSX to perform iterative refinement.
 In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides maximum
 componentwise error bound if possible. See comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM
 and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds. Note that this
 subroutine is only resonsible for setting the second fields of
 ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP.

.RS 4
\fIPREC_TYPE\fP 
.PP
.nf
          PREC_TYPE is INTEGER
     Specifies the intermediate precision to be used in refinement.
     The value is defined by ILAPREC(P) where P is a CHARACTER and
     P    = 'S':  Single

\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
       = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
       = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIN\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N is INTEGER
     The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
     matrix A.  N >= 0.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fINRHS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          NRHS is INTEGER
     The number of right-hand-sides, i.e., the number of columns of the
     matrix B.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
     On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fILDA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDA is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIAF\fP 
.PP
.nf
          AF is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAF,N)
     The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
     A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, as computed by CPOTRF.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fILDAF\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDAF is INTEGER
     The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF >= max(1,N).
.fi
.PP
.br
\fICOLEQU\fP 
.PP
.nf
          COLEQU is LOGICAL
     If .TRUE. then column equilibration was done to A before calling
     this routine. This is needed to compute the solution and error
     bounds correctly.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIC\fP 
.PP
.nf
          C is REAL array, dimension (N)
     The column scale factors for A. If COLEQU = .FALSE., C
     is not accessed. If C is input, each element of C should be a power
     of the radix to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates.
     Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless
     the result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
     lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
     input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
     reliable.

\fIBERR_OUT\fP 
.PP
.nf
          BERR_OUT is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
     On exit, BERR_OUT(j) contains the componentwise relative backward
     error for right-hand-side j from the formula
         max(i) ( abs(RES(i)) / ( abs(op(A_s))*abs(Y) + abs(B_s) )(i) )
     where abs(Z) is the componentwise absolute value of the matrix
     or vector Z. This is computed by CLA_LIN_BERR.

\fIN_NORMS\fP 
.PP
.nf
          N_NORMS is INTEGER
     Determines which error bounds to return (see ERR_BNDS_NORM
     and ERR_BNDS_COMP).
     If N_NORMS >= 1 return normwise error bounds.
     If N_NORMS >= 2 return componentwise error bounds.

\fIERR_BNDS_NORM\fP 
.PP
.nf
          ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
             max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
            ------------------------------
                  max_j abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
     below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
     returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
              radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

     This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
     above.
     See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
     cautions.

\fIERR_BNDS_COMP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
     For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
     various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
     componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

     Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                    abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
             max_j ----------------------
                         abs(X(j,i))

     The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
     componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
     information as described below. There currently are up to three
     pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
     componentwise accuracy is not requested (PARAMS(3) = 0.0), then
     ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS .LT. 3, then at most
     the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

     The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
     right-hand side.

     The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
     three fields:
     err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
              reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

     err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
              almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
              so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
              be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

     err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
              reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
              sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
              estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
              numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
              appropriately scaled matrix Z.
              Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
              current right-hand side and S scales each row of
              A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
              sums of Z are approximately 1.

     This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
     above.

          RCOND is REAL

     precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
     to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even

     permit convergence using approximate factorizations or
     factorizations other than LU. If the factorization uses a

     the infinity norm of Z. RTHRESH satisfies 0 < RTHRESH <= 1. The
